## Shadow

Subtlety is your art, the tip of the blade your brush. You studied at a secret college, specializing in alchemy, illusion, or shadow-magics. Your training and knowledge place you among the elite ranks of assassins, spies, and commandos. But more potent than any weapon or sorcery is your insight into your enemies' weaknesses.

**As a shadow, you possess abilities that deal significant damage, enable you to move swiftly across the battlefield and evade hazards, and allow you to fade from notice even in the midst of the most intense combat encounters. You also possess more skills than any other hero.**

"Whenever there is doubt, there is no doubt." **Motto of the College of Black Ash**

### Basics

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with an Agility of 2, and you can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristic scores:

- ¥ 2, 2, −1, −1
- ¥ 2, 1, 1, −1
- ¥ 2, 1, 0, 0
- ¥ 1, 1, 1, 0

**Weak Potency:** Agility − 2

**Average Potency:** Agility − 1

**Strong Potency:** Agility

**Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 18

**Stamina Gained at 2nd and Higher Levels:** 6

**Recoveries:** 8

**Skills:** You gain the Hide and Sneak skills (see Skills in Chapter 9: Tests). Then choose any five skills from Criminal Underworld or the skills of the exploration, interpersonal, or intrigue skill groups. (*Quick Build:*  Criminal Underworld, Hide, Lie, Pick Lock, Pick Pocket, Sabotage, Sneak.)

## 1st-Level Features

As a 1st-level shadow, you gain the following features.

## **Shadow College**

Shadow colleges are secret institutions that turn ordinary folk into something else. Finding a college is the first step in a rigorous initiation process that tests the mettle of an applicant. Even those who make the cut often wash out—or are kicked out—as the master shadows who teach stealth, magic, and assassination to their students are often less than gentle in their approach.

You graduated from a shadow college chosen from the following options, each of which grants you a skill. (*Quick Build:* College of Black Ash.)

- College of Black Ash: The College of Black Ash founded the art of being a shadow. Its graduates are unmatched in mobility, using sorcery to teleport around the battlefield, manipulate shadows, and summon darkness. You have the Magic skill.
- College of Caustic Alchemy: The College of Caustic Alchemy teaches its students recipes for the acids, bombs, and poisons used in their grim work. Graduates of the college are exceptional assassins. You have the Alchemy skill.
- College of the Harlequin Mask: Graduates of the College of the Harlequin Mask learn illusion magic, which they use to infiltrate enemy strongholds and create orchestrated chaos in combat. You have the Lie skill.

Your shadow college is your subclass, and your choice of college determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.

## <span id="page-175-0"></span>**Insight**

By observing your enemy, you learn how to use their weaknesses against them, building up a Heroic Resource called insight.

#### Insight in Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain insight equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 insight.

Additionally, the first time each combat round that you deal damage incorporating 1 or more surges, you gain 1 insight.

Whenever you use a heroic ability that makes use of a power roll, that ability costs 1 fewer insight if you have an edge or double edge on it. If the ability has multiple targets, the cost is reduced even if the ability gains an edge or has a double edge against only one target.

You lose any remaining insight at the end of the encounter.

#### Insight Outside of Combat

Although you can't gain insight outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost insight without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs insight, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited insight on its effect, such as Black Ash Teleport, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of insight equal to your Victories.

## **1st-Level College Features**

Your shadow college grants you one or two features, as shown on the 1st-Level College Features table.

| College         | Feature                    |

Effect: You envelop yourself in an illusion that makes you appear nonthreatening and harmless to your enemies. You might take on the appearance of a harmless animal of your size, such as a sheep or capybara, or you might appear as a less heroic and unarmed version of yourself. While this illusion lasts, your strikes gain an edge, and when you take the Disengage move action, you gain a +1 bonus to the distance you can shift.

The illusion ends when you harm another creature, when you physically interact with a creature, when you use this ability again, or when you end the illusion (no action required). If you end this illusion by harming another creature, you gain 1 surge.

Spend 1 Insight: Choose a creature whose size is no more than 1 greater than yours and who is within 10 squares. This ability's illusion makes you appear as that creature. This illusion covers your entire body, including clothing and armor, and alters your voice to sound like that of the creature. You gain an edge on tests made to convince the creature's allies that you are the creature.

#### Smoke Bomb

You always carry a supply of smoke bombs to use for distractions and easy getaways. You can use the Hide maneuver even if you are observed and don't initially have cover or concealment. When you do so, you can shift a number of squares equal to your Agility score. If you end this movement with cover or concealment, you are automatically hidden.

## Harlequin Gambit

Whenever you reduce an adjacent non-minion creature to 0 Stamina, you can immediately use a free maneuver to use your I'm No Threat ability and then move up to your speed.

If the creature is the same size as you, you can disguise yourself as them using I'm No Threat without spending insight. If you do, while I'm No Threat is active, the creature's body is disguised to look like your body. The illusion ends on their body if another creature physically interacts with it. When the illusion would end for either you or the creature's body, it ends for both.

## Trail of Cinders

Whenever you reduce a non-minion creature to 0 Stamina, you can immediately use a free maneuver to use your Black Ash Teleport ability.
