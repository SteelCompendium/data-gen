## NULL

T **he mind is not separate from the body. Perfection of one requires perfection of the other. You strive for perfect discipline, perfect order, mastery over mind and body, becoming an unarmed psionic warrior who dampens and absorbs magic and psionics. You require no weapons, no tools. You suffice.**

**As a null, you resist the supernatural forces of the universe with composure and confidence. As you strive for perfect order, you are an enemy of the ultimate expression of chaos: the supernatural. Those who break the laws of nature using sorcery or psionics should fear you.**

"Any weapon can be turned against the hand that wields it." **Ardashir**

## <span id="page-161-0"></span>Basics

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with an Agility of 2 and an Intuition of 2, and you can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristic scores:

- ¥ 2, −1, −1
- ¥ 1, 1, −1
- ¥ 1, 0, 0

**Weak Potency:** Intuition − 2

**Average Potency:** Intuition − 1

**Strong Potency:** Intuition

**Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 21

**Stamina Gained at 2nd and Higher Levels:** 9

#### **Recoveries:** 8

**Skills:** You gain the Psionics skill (see Skills in Chapter 9: Tests). Then choose any two skills from the interpersonal or lore skill groups. (*Quick Build:* Psionics, Read Person, Timescape.)

## 1st-Level Features

As a 1st-level null, you gain the following features.

## **Null Tradition**

Through extensive physical and psionic training, you have learned to unlock the full potential of your body. As you shape the growth of your power, you choose a null tradition from the following options, each of which grants you a skill. (*Quick Build:* Chronokinetic and the Monsters skill.)

- **Chronokinetic:** Your training unmoors you from temporal reality, allowing you to use the flow of time as another dimension that all things move through. You gain one skill from the lore group.
- **Cryokinetic:** You can tap into absolute cold, the most essential energy of myriad manifolds, and manifest its effects in your body. You gain one skill from the crafting group.
- **Metakinetic:** You learn to see through the illusions of the universe to more fully understand your body and its psionic potential. You gain one skill from the exploration group.

Your null tradition is your subclass, and your choice of tradition determines many of the features you'll gain as you gain new levels.

## <span id="page-161-1"></span>**Discipline**

As your mastery of your body and tradition grows, it imbues you with a Heroic Resource called discipline.

### Discipline in Combat

At the start of a combat encounter or some other stressful situation tracked in combat rounds (as determined by the Director), you gain discipline equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 discipline.

Additionally, the first time each combat round that an enemy in the area of your Null Field ability (see below) uses a main action, you gain 1 discipline. The first time each combat round that the Director uses an ability that costs Malice (see *[Draw Steel: Monsters](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Monsters)*), you gain 1 discipline.

You lose any remaining discipline at the end of the encounter.

#### Discipline Outside of Combat

Though you can't gain discipline outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost discipline without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect outside of combat that costs discipline, you can't use that same ability or effect outside of combat again until you earn 1 or more Victories or finish a respite.

When you use an ability outside of combat that lets you spend unlimited discipline on its effect, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of discipline equal to your Victories. (Such abilities aren't part of the core rules for the null, but they might appear in future products.)

## **Null Field**

You project a psionic field of order around your body, dampening the effects of supernatural abilities harmful to you and your allies.

#### **Null Field**

*You project an aura that dampens the power of your foes.*

![triangle symbol] 1 aura

**Area, Psionic Maneuver** e 1 aura x Each enemy in the area

Effect: Each target reduces their potencies by 1.

Once as a free maneuver on each of your turns, you can spend 1 discipline and give your Null Field one of the following additional effects until the start of your next turn:

- ¥ Gravitic Disruption: The first time on a turn that a target takes damage, you can slide them up to 2 squares.
- ¥ Inertial Anchor: Any target who starts their turn in the area can't shift.
- ¥ Synaptic Break: Whenever you or any ally uses an ability against a target that has a potency effect, the potency is increased by 1.

This ability remains active even after an encounter ends. It ends only if you are dying or if you willingly end it (no action required).

## **Inertial Shield**

Your instincts for danger let you predict attacks before they happen.

#### **Inertial Shield**

| <i>You intuit the course of an incoming attack, reducing its effects.</i> |

Spend 1 Discipline: The potency of one effect associated with the damage is reduced by 1 for you.

## **Discipline Mastery**

As you advance in your chosen null tradition, you gain certain benefits in combat, including benefits based on the amount of discipline you have. Benefits based on how much discipline you have last until the end of your turn, even if a benefit would become unavailable to you because of the amount of discipline you spend during your turn.

Some Discipline Mastery benefits can be applied only if you are a specific level or higher, with the level of those benefits noted in the tables below.

#### Chronokinetic Mastery

Whenever you use the Inertial Shield ability, you can use the Disengage move action as a free triggered action.

| Discipline         | Benefit                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2                  | Whenever you use the Knockback maneuver, you can target one additional creature. Additionally, whenever you deal untyped damage with a psionic ability, you can change it to cold damage instead. |
| 4                  | The first time on a turn that you grab a creature or an enemy moves 1 or more squares in the area of your Null Field ability, you gain 1 surge.                                                   |
