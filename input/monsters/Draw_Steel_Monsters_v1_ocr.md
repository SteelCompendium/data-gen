If you've opened up this book, then I imagine you're looking for some *Draw Steel* monsters. Maybe you're seeking a band of baddies to unleash on your Friday night game. Or maybe you want to soak in all the cool art as inspiration for your worldbuilding. Perhaps you're peeking at this book in your Director's reference pile right before you fight some hobgoblins-in which case, your character now has the title Sneaky Peeker. Whenever you search for hidden creatures, you can spend 1 Recovery to give yourself a double edge on the power roll.

I've been wrangling monsters for years now. I've read about monsters growing up, drawn pictures of monsters, written stories about them, fought them in games, hid from them in real life, and then eventually started making monsters professionally. You might have fought or controlled a few of my foes in MCDM's *Flee, Mortals*!, the spiritual predecessor to this book. Good news! Most of those monsters are here too!

*Draw Steel* is a new game with different priorities than many fantasy roleplaying games. We wanted to make sure that above all else, each monster can make a real impact on the heroes' decisions. We were able to take many of those already tactical, cinematic, villainous, and fantastical monsters in *Flee Mortals!* and crank up their traits and abilities to eleven. Those monsters also paved the way for a whole slew of new monsters who will make the heroes think twice about charging in carelessly! Players will have to prepare, have their characters form alliances, and find their party's synergies if they want to survive the threats that lurk between these pages.

"Well, what threats?" you might ask. For starters, we've got the ghastly war dog army, patchwork soldiers set to explode when they've outlived their usefulness. Then there's the radenwights, a band of swashbuckling rodentesque opportunists who dance across the battlefield. Maybe our crystalline dwarven engineers or the shadow elves who can attack characters across two worlds simultaneously are more your speed? Oh! Have you ever heard of a meteor dragon? There's one waiting for you in here, along with many more creatures ready to crash into all the adventures you'll be running in the future!

This book wouldn't be possible without so many people! The brilliant designers past and present who joined me in the monster mash. The testers who doomed hundreds of heroes so that future generations might stand a chance. The artists, editors, and members of the production team who all came together to make a gorgeous book-hell, two gorgeous books. It was a monumental effort on all fronts.

But most importantly, this book wouldn't be possible if we didn't have someone to make it for- YOU! If you've opened up this book, then this was a great success.

Good luck and have fun!

# Monster Basics

### **For the Director**

The information in *Draw Steel: Monsters* is intended for the Director's use, and all references to "you" in this book refer to the Director. All players are welcome to read this book, but we recommend stopping short of reading the monster stat blocks. Those are for the Director's eyes only.

# The Purpose of Monsters

In *Draw Steel*, heroes face monsters. Each goblin, human, or zombie the characters encounter has the potential to become a monster who must be overcome. This book provides you, the Director, with tools to use in these moments, as well as opportunities to explore who these creatures are before and after they and the heroes come to blows.

#### Every Goblin Has a Story

In *Draw Steel*, the relationship between hero and monster is a contextual one. Before and after conflict, a monster is another character in the story. Their status doesn't rely on whether a creature who regularly acts as a hero is nearby.

**Therefore, a monster stat block represents a moment in time.** It's an imperfect translation of a creature while they act as an enemy in opposition to one or more heroes. While the players of the heroes get to keep track of a character sheet for the entirety of the game, you use a monster's stat block solely while running combat. Trying to have that stat block provide every detail about each creature who might engage the heroes in some way can and will slow the game down.

The game asks you and the other players to imagine these creatures more complexly than simply noting the damage they deal to each other. Heroes have access to abilities, skills, and motivations that don't involve fighting monsters, and the same is true for all creatures. Most creatures in this book have a language, a culture, and a multifaceted relationship to the world in which they exist. They might share the same careers, upbringings, and complications as the heroes. They can even become allies to the heroes, adventuring alongside them as retainers or in competition with them as rivals.

You can utilize your own character sheets that detail important creatures' motivations, skills, and features in addition to the combat-focused features of a stat block. This can be a useful reference for playing a foe consistently across the tests and negotiations that are also part of an adventure, especially for enduring villains.

### **When Creatures Become Monsters**

The defining feature of a monster is that they impose their will on the world at the expense of someone else. A monster might take control of the land, summon a terrible force to destroy nature or settlements, or simply bring harm to someone weaker than them. This means that a creature driven by instinct who hunts for food isn't a monster unless they hunt outside their needs or their territory. Without malice or cruel ambitions that can be opposed, such creatures are no different from a force of nature.

### **A creature becomes a monster when their malice meets opposition.**

This often boils down to the monster fighting the hero over the fate of someone else. The game utilizes each monster in a way that challenges the heroes and their players, inviting the heroes to use their abilities to overcome the monster's will.

### **When Monsters Become Villains**

If a creature is *always* a monster, then they are a villain. Every aspect of a villain's values and worldview is imposed upon someone else, to the point where a villain's very existence is always in direct opposition to one or more heroes.

Villains typically have personal relationships to heroes that other monsters don't. There are universal or moral reasons for heroes and monsters to come to blows with one another, such as "Hurting people is wrong" or "That doesn't belong to you." But only a villain can take something important from a hero, stand for everything they oppose, or act as a corrupted reflection of them in a way that leaves the world worse off.

Usually, the struggle against a villain lasts much longer than a single fight. It's not enough to oppose a villain with intent, magic, and strength of arms. A hero also needs justice! The villain's will needs to be deconstructed and proven wrong before they are defeated, in a way that is cathartic to the hero and satisfying for all players.

As said above, a stat block represents a creature in battle. If a villain is reduced to 0 Stamina in combat but their main conflict with the heroes is not resolved, then they have lost the battle but not the war. They can make their retreat, lick their wounds, and try again later. Or if death is inevitable and their will is strong enough, a villain might return to haunt the heroes as an undead until one side finally prevails.

### **Coming to the Table**

Everyone who plays *Draw Steel* will have a different take on monsters based on their own experience. In the real world, "monster" has come to mean "the other," or that which is not us. The monster is an unknowable threat until it is either known or is no more. Often, "monster" describes ferocious beasts that can't be prevented from doing us harm. Horrifyingly more often, "monster" is used as a label for groups of people and whole cultures, usually as a means of denying their humanity.

Meanwhile in games, "monster" is a clinical term for an opposing force. The monster is the away team. The word describes game actors who challenge the characters' capability to achieve their goals. The monster has traits and abilities that the characters must overcome using their own traits and abilities. The monster provides the reason for the characters to have those traits and abilities in the first place.

It's worthwhile to discuss with your players how each of them would like to engage with *Draw Steel* ahead of embarking on a new adventure. After all, their heroes will inevitably face monsters, and conflict in the game should be more interesting than disagreements around it.

### **Everyone Loves Zombies**

For certain groups of players, imagining monsters beyond their game definition isn't fun. For others, building a morally ambiguous story around facing off against foes very much like their characters requires too much effort to be satisfying. Thankfully, *Draw Steel* comes with an assortment of undead, demons, and war dogs that can be fought with impunity. There will always be a need for heroes to rise up and protect innocent people from these sorts of programmed, irredeemable monsters, and doing so is no less heroic than overcoming a complex monster.

### **Other Sections**

Discussions of monsters, guidelines for encounter design, and the monster stat blocks that fill this book refer to the core rules of the game laid down in *Draw Steel: Heroes*. You can find information in that book on specific topics as follows:

- ¥Power rolls, edges and banes, Recoveries, respites, Victories, Orden, Vasloria, the timescape: Chapter 1: The Basics
- ¥Languages: Chapter 4: Background
- ¥Abilities, conditions, potencies, surges: Chapter 5: Classes
- ¥Actions and maneuvers, creature size, damage and Stamina, dying and death, movement and forced movement, high ground, winded, suffocating: Chapter 10: Combat
- ¥Discovering Lore, Finding a Cure, Crafting Treasures: Chapter 12: Downtime Projects
- ¥Supernatural treasures: Chapter 13: Rewards

### Monster Basics

To use this book, you'll also want to be familiar with the information found in *Draw Steel: Heroes*. If you read that book first, most of the information presented in the creature stat blocks in this book is self-explanatory, and follows the setup of the player characters' traits and abilities in many ways. However, a few differences are worth noting.

### **Languages**

If a creature knows at least one language, a "Languages" entry in their lore indicates which languages they know. Creatures who don't know any languages don't have this entry.

### **Keywords**

Each stat block has one or more creature keywords. These keywords don't necessarily mean anything on their own, but special rules might apply to them. For instance, a creature with the Goblin keyword benefits from and can contribute to goblin Malice features. (See Malice later in this introduction for information.)

### General Keywords

While many keywords are specific to a group of creatures, such as Gnoll or Human, other keywords are found across different monster groups.

### **Abyssal**

Creatures with the Abyssal keyword, such as demons and gnolls, can trace their origins back to the Abyssal Wasteland-a chaotic manifold whose denizens hunger for the souls of mortals.

### **Accursed**

Accursed creatures, such as medusas and werewolves, are under the effect of powerful supernatural curses that change their essential nature.

### **Animal**

The Animal keyword is an easy one! It covers bears, wolves, and really big spiders! Aside from the animals of the real world, fantasy creatures with a similar level of sapience and who are part of the natural world have the Animal keyword. Animals have only natural defenses.

### **Beast**

Creatures with the Beast keyword have animal-level sapience, but also possess supernatural abilities or traits. Basilisks and chimeras are examples of beasts. They don't have a society, but one has eye beams that can turn you into a statue, while the other has three heads-each belonging to a different species and one of which breathes fire!

### **Construct**

Construct creatures, such as the ashen hoarder and valok, are manufactured, with magic or psionics playing a role in giving them life. A construct's level of sapience is determined by the will and skill of their creator. Some function entirely on their own, while others serve as mindless drones who take action only if given orders. Unless otherwise noted, constructs don't need to eat, drink water, sleep, or breathe to survive.

### **Dragon**

Dragons, the giant reptilian creatures with breath weapons, wings, claws, and jaws, aren't the only creatures who take the Dragon keyword. Creatures related to dragons, such as draconians, also have this keyword.

### **Elemental**

If a creature can trace their origin back to Quintessence, the Manifold of Elements, they have the Elemental keyword. This includes creatures of raw elemental power, such as the crux of fire, and creatures who merely trace some part of their origin back to Quintessence, such as meteor dragons.

### **Fey**

Fey creatures can trace their origin back to Arcadia, a manifold of nature and magic that is the place of origin of all elves. Creatures from this plane often have an innate connection to nature, magic, or both.

### **Giant**

Creatures with the Giant keyword include ogres and trolls, as well as fire giants, frost giants, hill giants, and stone giants. Giants have similar body shapes to humanoids, but they're much larger. Despite that similar appearance, these creatures have no relation to most humanoids (other than the mighty hakaan).

### **Horror**

Horror creatures, including overminds and voiceless talkers, are creatures who appear unnatural on most worlds, particularly Orden. Everything about them is alien, and most have potent psionic abilities.

### **Humanoid**

Humanoid creatures, such as dwarves and time raiders, are size 1 creatures who have similar limb arrangements to and sapience on par with humans. Humanoids often gather in communities and form societies to survive and prosper.

### **Infernal**

Infernal creatures, such as devils and hobgoblins, can trace their origins back to the Seven Cities of Hell-an ordered manifold where the natives make plans to tempt mortals into contracts for their souls.

### **Ooze**

Ooze creatures, such as the gummy brick, are semisolid masses of moisture and malice who take shape in dark, damp environments. Their forms range from loosely congealed puddles to more hardened and calcified shapes.

### **Plant**

Plant creatures, such as the shambling mound, are made of vegetation. Like other creatures (and unlike plant objects), they can move and interact with their environment.

### **Swarm**

Swarm creatures are actually more than one creature! When a whole bunch of creatures get together, whether a swarm of spiders or a swarm of minotaurs, they move and act together as if they were one creature.

### **Undead**

Undead creatures, such as ghosts and zombies, are the reanimated flesh and spirits of once-living creatures who have died. Their level of sapience is determined by the creator or effect that brought them back from the dead. Some undead function entirely on their own, while others mindlessly seek to harm the living if given no other instructions. Unless otherwise noted, undead don't need to eat, drink water, sleep, or breathe to survive.

#### Encounter Value

Each Director-controlled creature has an encounter value (abbreviated EV) that is used in building encounters. See Step-by-Step Encounter Building later in this chapter for more information.

### **Combat Rounds**

Because stat blocks are focused on the tactics and mechanics of combat, all references in a stat block to "rounds" refer to combat rounds.

#### Creature Free Strikes

When a Director-controlled creature makes a free strike (see Chapter 10: Combat in *Draw Steel: Heroes*), they don't roll. Instead, their stat block notes a Free Strike value representing the amount of damage they deal with either of the following:

- A melee free strike with a distance of melee 1 or the melee distance of the creature's signature ability (see below), whichever is higher.
- A ranged free strike with a distance of 5 or the ranged distance of the creature's signature ability, whichever is higher.

A creature's free strike has the Strike keyword, as well as the Magic, Psionic, or Weapon keywords if those keywords are found in the creature's signature ability. Additionally, if the creature's signature ability deals damage of a specific type, the free strike also uses that damage type. If the creature's signature ability deals more than one type of damage, you decide which damage type the creature's free strike uses when the strike is made.

Creature free strikes are a static number for two reasons. First, it keeps gameplay fast. You don't have to stop play to roll dice, and there's no chance of a creature rolling a critical hit and bogging things down further when it isn't their turn. Second, by keeping these static values relatively low, heroes are encouraged to take more risks when it really counts, even if that might result in them taking damage from a free strike.

### Creature Opportunity Attacks

Even though a Director-controlled creature doesn't have to roll when they make a free strike, if that creature takes a bane on strikes against a target, they can't make an opportunity attack against that target.

### **Stat Block Self-Reference**

Whenever a creature's stat block talks about enemies or allies, it refers to enemies or allies of that creature by default. (Chapter 5: Classes of *Draw Steel: Heroes* talks about enemies and allies.) Likewise, if a stat block refers to a target "within X squares," that always means "within X squares of this creature" unless additional text says otherwise.

### **Signature Ability**

Every creature has a signature ability. This is the first action that appears in their stat block and is noted as "Signature Ability."

### **Traits**

Many creatures have traits, which are features that don't require a main action, a maneuver, or a triggered action to activate, such as the Crafty trait possessed by many goblins. (Chapter 10: Combat in *Draw Steel: Heroes* talks about action types.)

### **Malice**

Many creatures have abilities and features that require a Director's resource called Malice to activate. See Malice later in this introduction for more information.

### **End Effect**

Certain creatures have the ability to take damage in order to end one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw. The damage the creature takes to end an effect can't be reduced in any way.

### **Villain Actions**

The solo and leader creatures presented in this book are designed to be fought in climactic battles at the end of an adventure or campaign. Because of this, they have special abilities called villain actions.

A creature with villain actions always has three. Each villain action can be used only once per encounter, and no more than one villain action can be used per round. (This holds even if you have two or more creatures with villain actions in an encounter, though such an occurrence should be rare.)

A creature can use a villain action at the end of any other creature's turn during combat. Villain actions are numbered and intended to be used in a specific order that creates a logical encounter flow and cinematic arc, but you can use them in any order you choose.

The first villain action is an opener, which shows the heroes they're not battling a typical creature. Openers generally deal some damage, summon a lackey or three, buff the leader, debuff the heroes, or move the creature into an advantageous position. They're a taste of what's to come.

The second villain action provides crowd control. It typically activates after the heroes have had a chance to respond once or twice to the villain, move into position, and surround the villain. This second action helps the villain regain the upper hand. Like an opener, this action comes in many flavors, but it's even more powerful than an opener.

The third and final villain action is an ultimate move or "ult"-a showstopper that the villain can use to deal a devastating blow to the heroes before the end of the battle.

### **Creature Organization**

A level 1 ghoul isn't necessarily as strong as a level 1 orc! Most creature types have an overarching organization that determines the power level and encounter value of the monsters within it. Some modes of organization are built around large numbers of weaker creatures in encounters, while other modes prefer fewer but more formidable threats.

A creature's mode of organization appears after their level in a stat block. For example, most gnolls are organized as a horde, while shadow elves have the platoon organization. Some creatures have a main mode of organization and a handful of minions, while other creatures use a few different organization types.

Monsters are organized as follows.

### Minion

Minions are weaker enemies who are made to die fast and threaten heroes en masse. A battle with minions is one where the heroes are outnumbered and can experience the joy of cutting through fields of their enemies. Creatures organized as minions are meant to support monsters organized in other ways, and have a special set of rules for doing so (see Using Minions below).

Minions die quickly! In fact, some might die before they have a chance to act. That's okay! It's why you build encounters with them four at a time.

### Horde

Monsters organized as hordes are hardier and work in smaller groups than minions, but it still takes more than one of these creatures to effectively threaten a single hero of the same level. A battle against creatures all belonging to a horde sees those creatures outnumbering the heroes about two to one. Creatures who are part of a horde organization can be especially effective when brought into encounters alongside other horde creatures.

Horde creatures are more fragile than any other monsters except minions, so be sure to double or triple up on their stat blocks if they're key to a combat encounter. There's a chance that if the heroes act first in combat and have a lot of Victories, they can kill a number of key horde creatures before those creatures can act. That's why the encounter-building guidelines allow you to run lots of them.

### Platoon

Monster platoons are highly organized and usually self-sufficient armies. Platoons are well-rounded organizations well equipped to handle most combat objectives. A single platoon creature is a decent threat to a hero of the same level, so an encounter consisting entirely of these creatures typically has one per hero. Platoon creatures often fight alongside minions and an elite creature or two to round out their ranks.

### Elite

Elite creatures are the functional opposite of minions. A creature noted as an elite is hardy and can usually stand up to two heroes of the same level. Elites also have a high encounter value. They work well when individually supporting monsters with other modes of organization, but multiple elites can also be effective as a band on their own.

### Leader

A leader is a powerful monster who buffs their allies and grants them additional actions. They utilize villain actions and can stand toe-to-toe with two or more heroes of the same level by themself. Typically, only one leader appears in a battle at a time, alongside minions, horde or platoon creatures, and elites. Leader creatures have no additional creature role (see Creature Roles).

### Solo

A solo creature is an encounter all on their own. They have a special set of rules within their stat block and can be deployed... well, solo! A solo creature can typically stand toe-to-toe with six heroes of the same level. Solo creatures have no additional creature role.

### **Creature Roles**

A creature's role appears after their level and organization in their stat block, and describes that creature's function in combat in a general sense. Roles are descriptive, and most don't follow special rules. They simply help you build encounters and use creatures effectively in combat. (More detailed descriptions of these roles are found in Step-by-Step Encounter Building.)

### Ambusher

Ambushers are melee warriors who can slip by beefier heroes to reach squishier targets in the back lines.

### Artillery

Artillery creatures fight best from afar, and can use their most powerful abilities at great distance.

### Brute

Brutes are hardy creatures who have lots of Stamina and deal lots of damage. They have abilities and traits that make them difficult to ignore and hard to get away from, and that let them push enemies around.

### Controller

Controllers are creatures who change the battlefield, often with magic or psionics. They reposition foes and alter terrain to make it advantageous for their allies. Controllers are often on the squishier side, so they need protection!

### Defender

Defenders are tough creatures able to take a lot of damage, and who can force enemies to attack them instead of squishier targets. Defenders often act in squads with allies who have lower Stamina, such as controllers and hexers.

### Harrier

Harriers are mobile warriors who make definitive use of hit-and-run tactics. Their traits allow them to make the most of their positioning on the battlefield.

### Hexer

Hexers specialize in debuffing enemies using conditions and other effects. They are generally squishy and rely on others to defend them.

### Mount

Mounts are mobile creatures meant to be ridden in combat, and who make their riders even more dangerous.

### Support

Support creatures specialize in aiding their allies by providing buffs, healing, movement, or action options.

# **Creatures Who Defend**

A creature who takes the Defend main action (see Chapter 10: Combat of *Draw Steel: Heroes*) can't take additional main actions on their turn. This means that if a creature has already taken a main action on their turn, they can't also take the Defend main action. This applies even if the creature is granted an additional main action on their turn, unless they are specifically granted the ability to take the Defend main action.

### **Creatures Who Grab**

If a creature has an ability or trait that allows them to grab a target, they can have only one creature or object grabbed at a time unless their stat block specifies otherwise. If a creature has grabbed the maximum number of targets, the ability or trait they used to grab can't be used against another target unless the creature releases an already grabbed target.

### **Creatures Who Summon**

Unless otherwise specified, a creature or object summoned into a combat encounter by another creature takes their turn immediately after the summoner. Once a creature summons another creature, they can't do so again until the start of the summoner's next turn.

### **Creatures Who Heal Via Damage**

Some creatures have abilities that deal damage and allow the creautre using the ability to regain Stamina equal to the damage dealt. Unless otherwise specified, if this ability deals damage to multiple targets, the creature only regains Stamina equal to one instance of the damage, not the total damage dealt to all targets.

### **Harmless Creatures**

Inevitably, one or more noncombatants might get caught up in a dangerous situation the heroes are trying to get under control. If an adventure or encounter doesn't specify a noncombatant creature's statistics, you can use the following stat block for them.

| **Noncombatant**<br>Humanoid or Animal |                   |                  |                     |                    |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| 1S-2<br>Size                              | 5<br>Speed        | 8<br>Stamina     | 0<br>Stability      | 1<br>Free Strike   |
| Immunity: -<br>Movement: -                |                   |                  |                     | Weakness: -        |
| **M** ight 0                           | **A** gility 0 | **R** eason 0 | **I** ntuition 0 | **P** resence 0 |
| ★ Size                                    |                   |                  |                     |                    |

The noncombatant can be size 1S, 1M, 1L, or 2.

## Malice

Just as every hero has a Heroic Resource determined by their class, so too do the heroes' foes need their own juice to fuel their strongest threats. Malice is a resource gained and used by the Director. You use Malice to let enemies in the game activate their most powerful abilities and throw surprises at the heroes during combat.

### **Earning Malice**

At the start of combat, you gain Malice equal to the average number of Victories per hero. Then at the start of each combat round, you gain Malice equal to the number of heroes in the battle, plus the combat round number. For instance, if five heroes with three Victories each are just starting their first combat round, you begin that combat with 9 Malice-3 for the average number of Victories, 5 for the number of heroes, and 1 for the first round of combat. At the start of the next round, provided all the heroes are still alive, you gain 7 Malice-5 for the number of heroes plus 2 for the second round. As long as none of the heroes is taken out of the fight, you gain 8 Malice in the third round, 9 Malice in the fourth round, and so on.

If a hero dies, they stop generating Malice for you. At the end of an encounter, any unused Malice is lost.

It's up to you whether you want to show the players how much Malice you have. Some Directors feel that the tension of watching Malice creep up can create great drama, while others like to keep the players guessing about what Malice-fueled mayhem might come next. Do whatever is the most fun for your group, and if you're not sure, ask your players what they would prefer!

# **Spending Malice**

Monsters can spend Malice the way heroes spend their Heroic Resource, activating and enhancing their abilities. Abilities that make use of Malice have their Malice cost noted in a creature's stat block.

Specific types of monsters sometimes have other ways they can spend Malice once per turn, typically on features that affect an entire group of enemies, additional main actions or maneuvers they can take during their turn, or events that affect the encounter environment. Such features appear in a special **[Creature] Malice** stat block entry that precedes individual stat blocks in a creature's overall section.

You won't be able to spend Malice on every single option a given encounter has to offer. It's totally up to you how you deploy Malice. You can spend it on smaller but still impactful features each combat round. You can save it up and use it on a small number of extremely dramatic abilities. You can spend it on the same feature that uses all available Malice each combat round and then forget about it until the next round. Do whatever creates the most fun for you and makes the most narrative sense in a given encounter.

### **Basic Malice Features**

All monsters have access to the following Malice features, in addition to any "[Creature] Malice" features they might have.

### **Basic Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any monster's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features:

### s **Brutal Effectiveness 3 Malice**

The monster digs into the enemy's weak spot. The next ability the monster uses with a potency has that potency increased by 1.

s **Malicious Strike 5+ Malice** The monster pours all their animosity into their attack. Their next strike deals extra damage to one target equal to the monster's highest characteristic score. The extra damage increases by 1 for each additional Malice spent on this feature (to a maximum of three times the monster's highest characteristic). This feature can't be used two rounds in a row, even by different monsters.

### **That's So Much Malice!**

You often need to prepare only three Malice features for any given encounter, or four if you're running an encounter making use of multiple monster types or bands (for example, orcs and goblins). Just pick a feature costing 2 to 3 Malice, a feature costing 5 Malice, and a feature costing 7 to 10 Malice and you should be covered.


# Using Minions

What they lack in power, minions make up for in flexibility and their ability to let you control the battlefield. Creatures organized as minions work a little differently from other creatures because they're multiple monsters who function as a single unit under your control.

The knowledge of how minions work isn't a secret and shouldn't be kept from the players. Share the information in this section with them! They'll have a lot more fun battling minions a shaping narrative around taking out multiple foes at once if they understand how the rules work.

# **Organized as Squads**

Minions with the same name (for instance, goblin sniper) can be organized into squads of up to eight creatures. All members of a minion squad act together on the same initiative, and can make squad attacks (see Acting Together below).

### **Squad Size**

A squad of four war dog commandos with 4 Stamina each has a Stamina pool of 16. A squad of eight goblin spinecleavers with 5 Stamina each has a Stamina pool of 40.

# **Shared Low Stamina**

Minions have low Stamina and fall quickly in battle. They allow heroes to feel extra heroic, since a hero might kill several minions at once depending on those minions' level and encounter value!

Each squad of minions shares a Stamina pool, with initial Stamina equal to each individual minion's Stamina multiplied by the number of minions in the squad. For example, a goblin spinecleaver has 5 Stamina, so a squad of eight spinecleavers has a Stamina pool of 40. Whenever a minion in a squad takes damage, the squad's Stamina pool is reduced by a number equal to the damage taken. Because minion Stamina is tracked as a pool, minions can't be winded, can't regain Stamina, and can't gain temporary Stamina during a battle.

### Dropping One Minion

Whenever a minion squad's Stamina pool is reduced by an amount equal to an individual minion's Stamina, one minion dies or is otherwise taken out of the fight. If a squad of goblin spinecleavers has its Stamina pool reduced from 40 to 35, the minion who took the damage that reduced the pool dies. When the Stamina pool hits 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, and finally 0, another minion in the squad dies each time. If multiple minions take the damage that results in the pool dropping low enough to kill one minion, the creature who dealt the damage to the minions decides which of those minions dies. When a minion is taken out of the fight, they count as being reduced to 0 Stamina for triggering effects.

### **Damage**

The fury's Brutal Slam deals 12 damage to the squad of goblin spinecleavers, enough to kill two goblins. The goblin who was attacked dies first, followed by a goblin of the fury's choice.

### Dropping Multiple Minions

If a minion takes damage from any source except an area effect (including abilities with the Area keyword) and that damage reduces a minion squad's Stamina pool by an amount of damage equal to the Stamina of two or more minions, multiple minions are taken out by the damage. After dropping any minions who took the damage first, the minions nearest to those taken out suffer the same fate.

Allow the player to narrate how their hero takes out additional minions killed by a single attack. For instance, if a goblin spinecleaver takes 12 damage from a fury's Brutal Slam ability, maybe the minions surround the hero, who makes a brutal weapon strike that cuts through multiple targets with a single action. Maybe the body of the original target is hurled into an unfortunate ally. Maybe additional minions affected by a single-target strike pass out from fright! Taking out multiple minions is a chance to play up the cinematic aspect of the game.

### Minions and Area Effects

Minion squads are particularly susceptible to damage-dealing area abilities that target multiple creatures, because the minion squad's Stamina pool takes damage each time an individual minion takes damage. However, such area effects can kill only those minions who are in the area. For example, a tier 3 outcome for the talent's Incinerate ability deals 6 fire damage to each target in its area. If three goblin spinecleavers with Stamina 5 are caught in the area, the minion pool loses 15 Stamina instead of 18, leaving the other minions in the squad unscathed.

### **Area Damage**

The talent's Incinerate affects three out of the four goblin spinecleavers in the squad. The squad's Stamina pool only takes 15 damage total instead of 18.

### Minion Weakness and Immunity

If a minion has either a damage immunity or a damage weakness for a source of damage, apply the effects to the minion's squad once, even if multiple minions share the same immunity or weakness. These effects are the last things applied when calculating damage and can drop (or save!) multiple minions from any source of damage, including area effects.

### **Whoa! Those Minions Died Too Quickly!**

Minions are made to die fast. But if the heroes act first in a combat encounter, have a bunch of damage-dealing area abilities, and your minions are all bunched together, those minions might all go down much faster than planned perhaps before they even have a chance to do anything. It's a good idea to start a fight with any minions spread out from each other, close enough that heroes making use of area abilities won't entirely destroy your forces. And even if the heroes do manage to kill all your minions in one fell swoop, remember that you can always have reinforcements show up!

### Prepping Minion Stamina Pools

When you're preparing a battle with minions, it helps to take a moment and write out the different amounts of damage at which a minion squad suffers a loss of one of their minions. For instance, a squad of eight goblin spinecleavers loses a minion when they take a total of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 damage. If you do the math before combat starts (or take a quick moment to jot it down during a pause in combat), it'll help your game run smoothly.

### **Acting Together**

When minions act, each minion in the squad uses their main action in concert. This is because minions have squad actions (see below) that require participation from all minions, requiring all attacks by a squad to happen at the same time. Individual minions can choose to waste their main action doing nothing when the rest of their squad uses their main action in concert, or can use a maneuver only to alleviate their own circumstances (see Minion Maneuvers).

### Minion Action Economy

Minion turns are meant to be short. On their shared turn, each minion can take only a move action and a main action, a move action and a maneuver, or two move actions.

Individual minions can also make opportunity attacks. That said, minions usually don't have bespoke triggered actions, keeping them easy to run.

### Squad Action

Each minion has a signature ability that is typically a strike targeting one creature or object. When multiple minions in a squad use their signature ability on a turn, you make one roll for the whole squad.

Each target of a minion's signature ability is affected by only one instance of the ability. But when two or three (at maximum) of a squad's minions attack the same creature or object simultaneously, each additional minion causes the signature ability to deal extra damage to the target equal to the minion's free strike value. Because a minion's free strike value is typically lower than the average damage of their signature ability, it's usually more effective to have each minion target a different hero.

As an example, a squad of three demon pitlings are attacking a shadow and a conduit with their Spit signature ability, with a tier 2 outcome on the power roll. One pitling targets the shadow, dealing 4 poison damage. Two pitlings target the conduit, dealing 4 poison damage plus an extra 2 poison damage for the additional pitling.

If a minion squad scores a critical hit with their signature ability, all the minions who participated in using the ability can take another main action.

### **Squad Action**

Two targets are within distance of three pitlings taking the Spit squad action. One pitling spits at the shadow for 4 damage, one pitling spits at the conduit for 4 damage, and the remaining pitling deals an extra 2 damage to the conduit.

### Minion Maneuvers

Minions in a squad use the Grab, Hide, Knockback, and Search for Hidden Creatures maneuvers together. For Grab, Knockback, and Search in particular, you make one roll for the whole squad, and each target of a minion's maneuver is only affected by one instance of the ability.

A minion can take any other maneuver individually, usually to alleviate their own circumstances like standing up from prone or escaping a grab. If they do, they can't participate in their squad's main action or maneuver during the turn.

### Free Strike Together

If several minions in a squad make a free strike at the same target at the same time, such as from a hero provoking an opportunity attack by moving away from several minions surrounding them, the damage from each minion's free strike is added together and treated as one strike.

### Tracking Squads

If you use multiple squads made up of the same type of minions in an encounter-for instance, two squads of goblin spinecleavers-it's important to make it easy for the players to tell the squads apart. You can use different miniatures for each squad, or give each squad's miniatures or tokens an indicator (a colored magnet, ring, sticker, and so forth) to help keep track of which minions are part of the same squad as they start moving around on the battlefield. Many online virtual tabletops have tools for adding colors or textures to icons that make tracking different squads easy.

# **Attached Squad Captain**

Any non-mount, non-minion creature, who speaks a language that a squad of minions can understand can be attached to that squad as a captain. Captains aren't necessarily strategic leaders with brilliant tactics. Sometimes they're just powerful creatures who bully, inspire, or have some supernatural influence that drives other creatures to action.

A squad of minions can have only one captain, and a creature can't be captain to more than one squad of minions.

### Separate Actions and Stamina

A captain takes their turn at the same time as the minion members of their squad but isn't limited in their action options as minions are. A captain's Stamina isn't added to a minion squad's Stamina pool, and is tracked as for any other creature in combat.

### Captain Benefits

While a minion squad has a captain, each minion in the squad gains the benefits noted at the "With Captain" entry on their stat block. Usually, this benefit is either a damage boost, a bonus to speed, or additional Stamina.

### I Am the Captain Now

If a squad of minions loses their captain, a new allied creature can become that squad's captain at the start of the next round (no action required).

### **Stat Block Icons**

The stat blocks in this book contain multiple different icons that allow quick scanning for just the right trait or ability for the situation. The following list provides examples of the most common icons you'll come across.

- e The **distance** of the ability
- x The **targets** or affected area of the ability
- t A **trait** of the creature, often a feature that is always in effect
- m A **melee** ability
- r A **ranged** ability
- v An ability that is **melee** or **ranged** (your choice)
- s A **self** ability that only targets the user
- a A **cube**, **line**, or **wall** area ability
- b An **aura** or **burst** area ability
- p A **special** ability with a unique distance, often the entire encounter map
- ! A **triggered action**
- d A feature or ability specific to a leader or solo creature, such as **villain actions**

## Step-by-Step Encounter Building

An encounter is a scene in which the heroes are faced with challenges or opposition. As soon as the players have made their heroes and are ready to see those heroes put into interesting situations, encounter building is the focus of your game! The step-by-step guidelines in this section are focused primarily on building combat encounters, where battle is a highly likely (and often eagerly expected) outcome.

### **It's Not Science**

While we'd love to create an encounter-building formula that could predict the exact difficulty of any combat encounter, there are too many variables beyond the monsters you choose for your encounters that we can't account for. The heroes your players create, the encounter maps you choose, the number of supernatural treasures the characters create or collect, lucky and unlucky dice rolls, each player's tactical acumen, and a bad day at the office before game night can all contribute to an encounter going better or worse for the heroes as they play the game.

The guidelines in this section will help get you closer to the kind of encounter you desire, but it'll take a bit of trial and error to figure out the best approach to encounter building for you and your group. For example, if the heroes in your game have a lot of damage-dealing area abilities, they're going to have an easier time standing up to minions. If you have heroes who specialize in single-target abilities, they might be able to quickly destroy a solo.

Learn what makes a fun, challenging encounter for your group, and adjust these guidelines to fit your needs. And remember that reinforcements can always be on the way for any side who needs them if an encounter is too easy or too hard.

### **Step 1: Think**

Building an encounter is almost like creating a character! Every encounter should have the following:

- A backstory or inciting incident.
- Cool monsters.
- A motivation for the participants to be there.
- Stakes, or consequences for failure, for all individuals involved.
- One or more opportunities for the heroes and villains to learn more about their opponents-or themselves!
- An interesting map that provokes the heroes to think about their moves as a team (see Choosing a Map later in this section).

### **Step 2: Choose Encounter Difficulty**

After thinking about the components of your encounter, it's time to determine how difficult an encounter you want to create. Encounters are rated by categories of difficulty, as follows.

### Trivial Encounters

Trivial encounters are easier than easy. They present no challenge at all for the heroes, who are guaranteed to survive the battle with their Stamina mostly, if not entirely, untouched. Think 10th-level heroes taking on a small horde of typical kobolds. There's no way the fight ends well for the kobolds. These encounters can be fun to occasionally throw into your game, but for many groups, the novelty disappears quickly; too many trivial encounters can feel like a waste of time.

Unless you determine otherwise, trivial encounters don't earn the heroes any Victories.

### Easy Encounters

Unless the heroes have already depleted most of their Stamina and Recoveries, easy encounters won't threaten their lives. Easy encounters are great for adventures that want to give the characters a lot of battles between respites, or for when you want them to feel like superheroes while still overcoming a combat challenge that feels as though it's within their pay grade.

An easy encounter is typically worth 1 Victory.

### Standard Encounters

Standard encounters are the most common for many adventuring groups. These battles deplete some of the heroes' Stamina and Recoveries, especially for melee-focused heroes. Although character death is uncommon in a standard encounter, it isn't impossible, especially if a player makes a poor tactical choice or finds that the dice are against them.

A standard encounter is typically worth 1 Victory.

### Hard Encounters

Hard encounters are typically climactic encounters with leaders and their loyal servants, or some other scenario that puts the heroes' lives in real peril. Hard encounters are winnable, but the heroes need to play smart to survive.

A hard encounter is typically worth 2 Victories.

### Extreme Encounters

Extreme encounters feature threats of a level that the heroes aren't likely to survive if they try to fight to the bitter end. Such encounters rarely appear in most campaigns, though if the heroes are 8th level or higher, they can typically survive such encounters-or have a good chance of coming back to life afterward.

An extreme encounter is typically worth 2 or more Victories.

### **Step 3: Determine Encounter Strength**

To determine how many creatures and other types of challenges you should have in an encounter, you need to figure out the heroes' encounter strength (abbreviated ES). A party's encounter strength is used as a benchmark for "buying" monsters for your encounter, as explained below.

To calculate a party's ES, first determine each hero's encounter strength. This starts at a baseline of 4, to which you add 2 for each level of the hero. For instance, a 3rd-level hero has an encounter strength of 10 (4 + 2 + 2 + 2). Then add the encounter strength of all heroes together, and that's your encounter strength. This means a group of five 3rd-level heroes has an ES of 50.

Each retainer or other NPC fighting alongside the heroes counts as a hero when determining encounter strength. If a 3rd-level retainer or NPC fights alongside the heroes, they count as a 3rd-level hero.

| Encounter Strength |                   |    |    |    |     |     |     |     |
|--------------------|-------------------|----|----|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|                    | Number of Heroes* |    |    |    |     |     |     |     |
| Hero Level         | 1                 | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8   |
| 1st                | 6                 | 12 | 18 | 24 | 30  | 36  | 42  | 48  |
| 2nd                | 8                 | 16 | 24 | 32 | 40  | 48  | 56  | 64  |

\*Add one Hero for every 2 Victories the heroes have earned on average.

### Factor in Victories

Victories make heroes more powerful on the way to their next level. For every 2 Victories the heroes have earned on average, increase the party's encounter strength as if there were another hero in the party. For instance, if a party of 3rd-level heroes has 2 or 3 Victories each, increase the ES by 10. If they have 6 Victories each, increase the ES by 30. Be careful that the larger encounter strength doesn't lead you to using more creatures than recommended in Number of Creatures below. It's usually better to use higher-cost creatures in an encounter rather than add extra creatures when increasing encounter strength because of Victories.

Since you can rarely predict the exact order in which the heroes will face encounters during an adventure, it helps to keep a list of monsters with an EV cost worth roughly the encounter strength of two, four, and six Victories that make sense for the adventure you're running. You can then easily drop or swap these creatures into an encounter on the fly.

### **Step 4: Determine Encounter Budget**

Once you know the party's encounter strength and have chosen your encounter difficulty, you can determine your encounter budget as follows:

- Trivial encounters have a budget that is anything less than the party's ES minus the encounter strength of one hero.
- Easy encounters have a budget of anything less than the party's ES but more than the budget for a trivial encounter.
- Standard encounters have a budget that is between the party's ES and the party's ES plus the encounter strength of one hero.
- Hard encounters have a budget greater than a standard encounter, but no more than the party's ES plus the encounter strength of three heroes.
- Extreme encounters have a budget that is anything greater than hard.

resources isn't an exact science.

The luck of the dice, the number of treasures claimed, the composition of encounters, and the strengths of the heroes all factor into this math. And heroes might want to stop for a respite while they still have plenty of Recoveries because they have a downtime project they want to advance, or because they're ready to turn their Victories into XP and gain a new level.

Even if we could account for all those factors, your game might have outlier experiences in which the party has to stop and rest a little earlier than you'd expected, or will push through long after you thought they'd stop. We think that's a good thing. Part of the fun of roleplaying games is the fact that they're unpredictable, with the dice and the decisions the heroes make both playing a big part in the story. When players push on because they have a lot of Victories, that's the game working as intended.

### **Encounters Should Have Narrative Importance**

Combat encounters should hold narrative weight. *Draw Steel* isn't a game of attrition, where a few trivial combat encounters can weaken the heroes or winnow down their resources to make the final, important, epic clash with the villain more of a struggle. A quick combat encounter with two bumbling guards at a gate is likely over in less than a round, and shouldn't earn the heroes a Victory. It's probably better handled with a test. These can be fun scenes to roleplay, but they aren't going to make full use of your heroes' features and should only occur sometimes. Most of the time when combat occurs, the stakes for the heroes and the story should be high!

### **Step 5: Spend Encounter Budget**

You spend your encounter budget to "buy" hostile creatures to take part in your encounter. Each such creature costs a number of budget points equal to its encounter value (EV), as noted in the creature's stat block. When choosing creatures, try to choose a variety of creature roles for a more dynamic combat experience.

### Consider Creature Level

To ensure an encounter is challenging but not devastating for the players, you want to choose creatures whose level is no more than 2 greater than the heroes' level. For instance, creatures of level 7 and below are appropriate challenges for a party of 5th-level heroes. If the heroes have 6 or more Victories, you can push the upper limit to within 3 levels of the heroes.

Solo creatures are an exception. A solo creature's abilities dish out a lot of damage for their level, so restrict them to no more than 1 level above the heroes' average level, unless you want the very real threat of a few heroic corpses lying on the battlefield in the aftermath.

Some creatures outside of these level ranges might fall into your EV budget, but such creatures have the potential to deal devastating damage before a hero gets to do anything about it. That means characters could die after relatively few attacks from such a creature, and that the potencies of the creature's abilities might be nearly impossible to resist. None of that is likely to feel very heroic.

This comparison is the only indicator that level serves in encounter building. Everything else relies on the encounter value and organization mode of your monsters.

### Minions Come in Groups of Four

Whenever you spend EV to buy minions for a combat encounter, you buy them four at a time. It's recommended to buy at least two sets of minions for any given encounter, as they won't be effective in smaller numbers.

The minions you buy can be arranged into squads of any size you need, up to a maximum of eight minions in a squad. With eight minions, you could make one squad of eight, two squads of four and four, a squad of three and a squad of five, or squads of three, three, and two. More minions in a squad leads to more effective minion turns, whereas more squads of minions are usually easier to track.

### Number of Creatures

Too many creatures or too many different stat blocks in an encounter can create a big cognitive load for you, potentially turning an exciting combat into a slog.

In general, you don't want more than eight creatures per hero at a time in any encounter. Additionally, if the encounter has more than three creatures per hero, at least half the creatures in that encounter should be minions.

When it comes to number of stat blocks, you typically don't want to use more than six different kinds of stat blocks in an encounter, though you can probably manage more if you're using a lot of simple minion stat blocks. Especially if you're just starting out as a Director, keep the variety of your stat blocks limited until you're confident in your ability to run a complex combat encounter.

### Star of the Show

Sometimes a combat encounter features a creature who you want to stick around for more than a single combat round, so they can leave a lasting impression on the heroes. Such creatures are typically the named villains who the heroes face in the climax of an adventure or campaign.

If you want a creature to stick around in a combat encounter and become the star of the show, set up a hard encounter and choose a leader or solo creature with an EV that is at least one-third of the encounter budget.

### Dynamic Terrain Objects

The final section of this book introduces and details dynamic terrain objects-thematic elements you can place in an encounter to challenge the heroes. You can spend your EV budget on dynamic terrain objects the same way you do on monsters. Adding one or two dynamic terrain objects to an encounter gives the heroes a challenge to overcome or resolve beyond simply exchanging blows with another creature. See Dynamic Terrain for more information.

### **Step 6: Build Initiative Groups**

Once you have your encounter's foes selected, you'll put them together in initiative groups, with all creatures in the same initiative group acting on the same turn.

Though it's not a hard and fast rule, as you build your initiative groups, try to keep the total EV of any group between the encounter strength of one to two heroes (see the Encounter Strength table at Step 3 above). Doing so helps to ensure that the foes in each encounter group can hold their own against any one hero in the party without overwhelming that character.

It's okay to have one initiative group with a total EV of less than the recommendation above. It's also okay for a group to be worth more than two heroes, as long as that group consists of a single creature or the heroes have racked up a lot of Victories.

### How Many Initiative Groups?

In a battle without a solo creature, you want about as many initiative groups as the number of heroes, plus or minus one or two. This gives you a healthy range of groups to play with and makes your turns effective without being overwhelming for the heroes.

# **Quick Encounter Building**

The encounter-building information detailed above is intentionally comprehensive. But if you want to build an encounter quickly without doing a lot of math, good news! We've got a formula or two you can use to build an encounter quickly after you determine its difficulty. After going through this process, you can then build your initiative groups.

### Step 1: Party Size, Level, and Victories

What level are the heroes? How many heroes are there? Write down that information, which you'll use in a bit.

How many Victories do the characters have on average? For every two Victories the characters have, add another hero to the party for the purpose of this method of encounter building.

### Step 2: Buy Creatures to Fill Hero Slots

Your encounter has a number of hero slots equal to the number of heroes in the party you calculated in step 1. This number will be greater than the actual number of characters if the heroes have two or more Victories.

Each hero slot can be filled with a certain number of creatures, as follows:

- Eight minions fill one hero slot.
- Two horde creatures fill one hero slot.
- One platoon creature fills one hero slot.
- One leader or elite creature fills two hero slots.
- One solo creature fills six hero slots plus one slot for each level the creature is higher than the heroes.

You adjust your hero slots according to encounter difficulty, which then dictates the level of the creatures you use to fill those slots:

- For a trivial encounter, subtract two hero slots. Use only creatures of the heroes' level or lower.
- For an easy encounter, subtract one hero slot. Use only creatures of the heroes' level or one level higher.
- For a standard encounter, use creatures of the heroes' level or one level higher. You can add one more hero slot if none of the creatures are a higher level than the heroes.
- For a hard encounter, add two hero slots. Use creatures of the heroes' level and up to two levels higher, or up to one level higher for solo creatures. You can add one more hero slot if not all the creatures in the encounter are a higher level than the heroes.
- For an extreme encounter, add four or more hero slots. Then fill all those slots with creatures of the heroes' level or higher.

### Step 3: Add Dynamic Terrain Objects

Include one or two dynamic terrain objects for encounters of standard difficulty or easier. Add two to three dynamic terrain objects to hard and extreme encounters. Use only objects of the heroes' level or lower.

### **Parties Large and Small**

*Draw Steel* was made and tested with groups of mainly three to six heroes, including retainers, since that's how we expected most folks will play the game. If your group is smaller or larger than that, don't panic! The game still works and will be a lot of fun for you, but you'll want to keep the following guidelines in mind:

For a party of seven or more heroes, you'll find that solo creatures don't quite live up to their name. So give the solo creatures some lackeys or a few more dynamic terrain objects to help them challenge the heroes. If you want to build an encounter using two solo creatures and the EV math works out, just pay attention to the rules about villain actions and avoid having both solos focus fire on the same character at the same time.

For a party of three or fewer heroes, consider giving those heroes retainers to make up the difference. Parties that small can struggle against solo creatures and big groups of minions, given how much damage such foes have to spread around each turn.

#### Using Creature Roles and Organization

A creature's role and organization mode helps you build interesting encounters with varied challenges. Although including creatures covering every type of role in a combat encounter is likely to make that encounter too complicated for most groups, a fight against creatures who all have the same role typically leads to dull, grindy combat. An encounter with a controller, two defenders, and two harriers is more interesting and fun than an encounter with five harriers, greatly reducing the risk of playing out a battle where both sides simply stand still and deal damage without anything dynamic or dramatic happening.

### Ambusher Creatures

Ambusher creatures can hide, turn invisible, or otherwise find ways to get the drop on their enemies. They typically spend half their turn attacking, and the other half slipping away and hiding. Ambushers focus on taking down a single hero, sometimes dragging their target into the place where they hide.

Encounters that include ambushers should have plenty of cover or concealment, giving them places to hide. Adding other creatures typically brutes, defenders, harriers, or minions-keeps other heroes busy while the ambusher focuses on taking down a chosen foe.

### Artillery Creatures

Artillery creatures are great at ranged combat and can damage heroes who typically hang back behind beefier allies. Most artillery creatures are weak in melee, so add some minions, brutes, or defenders for them to hide behind during combat.

On their turn in combat, an artillery creature typically tries to move away from nearby foes, putting a brute, defender, or other ally between themself and nearby threats before attacking an enemy. If forced into melee, most artillery creatures do whatever they can to get away, including converting their main action into a move action to flee even farther. If no enemies are closing in, artillery creatures move to keep the heroes at the edge of their range, often focusing first on the biggest threat to their allies.

### Brute Creatures

Brute creatures hit hard and have a lot of Stamina. Their damage output can't be ignored, so heroes often focus on taking down brutes ahead of other creatures who have less Stamina or are weaker in melee. Brutes need to get up close to perform their most devastating attacks, so they work best on smaller battlefields. On their turn in combat, a brute moves toward the closest group of enemies and attacks, preferring to engage multiple foes at once. Brutes are often simpler to run than other creatures, so you can include a lot of them in an encounter.

### Controller Creatures

With their ability to hamper and move heroes, controllers make a dynamic addition to any battle. They often have complicated actions and traits that create unique effects, so most combat encounters shouldn't have more than two controllers.

Many controllers work best when they have brutes, defenders, harriers, and minions protecting them and taking advantage of the effects they create. Controllers often use their biggest and most powerful effects at the start of an encounter, targeting as many foes as possible. If a controller can't affect multiple heroes or use their most powerful feature, they focus on manipulating the battlefield and repositioning so they can use that feature on their next turn.

### Defender Creatures

Defender creatures defend their allies by drawing the heroes' attacks. They make excellent protectors for ambushers, artillery creatures, controllers, and support creatures, as well as for leaders. Defenders don't need to stay close to the creatures they protect-and it's better if they don't. A defender who breaks away from their charge can often lock down a threat far from the rest of the fight.

During combat, defenders engage heroes who are strong in melee. A defender battles as many foes as they can reach so their allies can freely move. If more than one defender is in a battle, they typically split up, each fighting a different hero.

### Harrier Creatures

Harrier creatures make battles dynamic. They can move to attack vulnerable heroes who are weaker in melee, then retreat (assuming they can do so safely) to protect their artillery, controller, and support allies, as well as leaders. Since harriers can often outrun and outmaneuver heroes, this forces the heroes to act tactically. Harriers pair well with creatures of any role, including other harriers.

### Hexer Creatures

Hexers like to hamper other creatures and target the foes they think are most likely to succumb to their debuffing abilities. If a hero has a great turn cutting down the hexer's allies, odds are they're the threat the hexer wants to stop the first chance they have.

Like controllers, hexers are typically complicated and a bit squishy. One or two hexers with a lot of protection from allies can make for a fun encounter.

### Leader and Support Creatures

Leader creatures have villain actions (see Villain Actions earlier in this introduction) and fight best alongside allies. Creatures with the support role function much like leaders, but they lack villain actions and are less complex. Leader and support creatures buff and heal their allies, and can grant those allies extra movement and actions. They remain close to their allies so their features can benefit as many targets as possible.

As long as a leader or a support creature stays in the fight, their allies are enhanced. They are most effective when protected by and buffing artillery, brutes, defenders, harriers, and minions. You typically shouldn't use more than one leader or support creature in an encounter, as their overlapping enhancements can turn a seemingly routine combat into a fatal one.

### Minion Creatures

As discussed in the Using Minions section earlier in this chapter, minions allow you to create cinematic battles where the characters feel heroic as they cut through multiple foes at once. Using minions of a level within two levels of the characters' average level also keeps them dangerous and relevant. When minions work together, they can't be ignored, as they deal a lot of damage and can easily lock characters down. Minions make decent protectors for ambushers, artillery, and controllers, as well as for leaders.

### Mount Creatures

Mount creatures are good for carrying other creatures into battle. Mounts of size 2 and smaller are typically meant to carry a single rider, while larger mounts can carry more creatures. Adding mounts to combat encounters makes the creatures riding them much faster. They pair well with artillery, brutes, controllers, hexers, and support creatures, as well as with leaders. Mounts without riders can also serve the same purpose as harriers in combat.

### Solo Creatures

Solo creatures can stand as an encounter all on their own for a group of four to six heroes. Their villain actions allow them to hamper and harm foes outside of the regular turn order. Solo creatures are best encountered alone, and fight most effectively in environments with plenty of space to move around and find cover.

Solo creatures use every movement advantage they have, whether burrowing, climbing, flying, swimming, or teleporting around the battlefield on their turn. They focus on whichever hero threatens them most effectively, even as they position themselves to target as many foes as possible with their area abilities.

### **Instant Solo Creature**

Most leaders and elite creatures can be adapted into a solo creature on the fly with the following adjustments:

- ¥Multiply their EV by 3.
- ¥Multiply their Stamina by 2.5.
- ¥Give them the following trait:

**Solo Turns** The creature can take two turns each round. They can't take turns consecutively.

¥Give them the following trait if they don't already have it:

**End Effect** At the end of each of their turns, the creature can take 10 damage to end one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw. This damage can't be reduced in any way.

¥Give them the following Malice feature:

### **Solo Action** 5 Malice

The creature takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

# **Choosing a Map**

Taverns have tables, forests have trees, castles have pillars, and fields have uneven terrain. The best maps for *Draw Steel* combat encounters have interesting environmental features, and you'll want to choose a map for your encounter that brings the most out of the rules for movement, difficult terrain, and falling.

Your ideal encounter map might feature ledges, columns, walls, windows, dynamic terrain objects, and the like for creatures to be thrown into, thrown off of, thrown through, or simply use for cover. Even one major fixture of interest on an encounter map can spark the players to think about how to incorporate that feature into their turns. You'll also want most of your battles to take place in environments with plenty of space to move around, avoiding a lot of long corridors 1 square wide.

Vertical maps are especially great, as an area with high ledges can lead to a surprising amount of damage for nonflying allies and enemies alike. Use flat maps sparingly, reserving them for dramatic showdowns in which heroes and villains must test their strength and convictions against each other with no distractions. Though even then, a map might have a throne to ascend in the center and steep edges on all sides.

You don't have to be a master artist to create a great tactical map. You can use hand-drawn shapes and lines on an erasable mat or virtual tabletop to represent cliffs, hazards, and more. You can also find incredible maps online. Some are free, and most others are available for a reasonable price on the websites of many great cartographers.

### **Making Objectives Known**

Encounters work best if the players have a good idea of what their characters are working toward, but you don't need to state objectives outright at the start of every battle. Not all groups want to commence combat with you saying, "Your objectives are to break the eldritch machine and destroy the vampire lord," if doing so takes the players out of the game's narrative.

In many combat encounters, the objectives are obvious. For instance, in a battle against a necromancer controlling a horde of undead minions, the players probably don't need to be told that defeating the necromancer ends the encounter. In an encounter against cultists performing a world-ending ritual, the heroes can guess that stopping the ritual is one of their objectives. In fact, specifically achieving that objective might well be what inspired them to undertake the adventure. They're not there for karaoke at the end of existence!

Not all objectives are so clear, however. In a battle against a goblin cursespitter, a kobold legionary, and three human knaves guarding the entrance to a bandit fortress, it can be easy to assume that the objective is simply "Defeat them all!" But if it's the case that the cursespitter leads the group and defeating the goblin causes the remaining forces to fall apart, it helps if you provide at least a hint of that setup at the start of the battle. The cursespitter could clearly issue orders and even call the other bandits cowards, demanding that they not run away "like last time!"

# Encounter Objectives

Specific objectives for combat encounters let you create and run fights that are about more than characters hacking down their foes to the last point of Stamina. Chapter 10: Combat in *Draw Steel: Heroes* gives an overview of different combat objectives you can set for the heroes to achieve during an encounter, setting out what's achievable in each objective so the players know what's expected of them. This section breaks out those objectives in detail, providing examples you can use and modify for your games.

If your encounter has an objective, start with the objective first and then pick enemies who can best make that objective a fun challenge for the heroes. Each objective gives advice regarding the types of monsters who fit well into the objective, but it's just advice. The encounter map you choose and the specific heroes you're preparing for might suggest better choices.

The writeup for each of these objectives includes the following sections:

- **Monster Roles and Organization** tells you which types of creatures are best used in the encounter.
- **Map Advice** covers what to think about when selecting a map for an encounter.
- **Difficulty Modifier** tells you how the objective can change an encounter's difficulty, typically increasing or decreasing the difficulty by one level (for instance, from standard to hard or standard to easy).
- **Success Condition** details what the heroes must do to win the day. When a success condition is met, the heroes' enemies flee or surrender, or you can utilize the dramatic finish or event ending encounter-end options described in Chapter 10: Combat of *Draw Steel: Heroes*.
- **Victories** tells you how many Victories each hero earns for completing the encounter, based on the encounter's difficulty.
- **Failure Condition** sets out what happens when the heroes have failed and the enemies win.

### **Fun Is Most Important**

If the heroes quickly achieve an encounter's objective but are still having a great time, you don't need to call off combat at that point. Maybe the foes who would normally flee or surrender decide to make a last stand! Maybe reinforcements show up, or a new objective appears in the form of innocent bystanders shouting for help or nearby cultists performing a ritual.

By contrast, the most fun for the players sometimes comes from having a fight cut short. If the characters come up with a clever plan that works to end the encounter early, let that happen and enjoy the players high-fiving each other in a victorious celebration.

### **Diminish Numbers**

The simplest combat encounter objective is almost always "defeat them before they defeat us." Though the heroes don't have to kill every last enemy in this type of encounter, winning the day requires that they push their opponents to the point where they are broken, flee, or surrender.

### Monster Roles and Organization

Monsters of any role make sense for this objective, so use a good mix of roles to challenge the characters and players. Put artillery creatures in hard-to-reach places, pair up defenders with controllers and hexers, and put brutes on the front line to give the heroes something to cut through as they seek more-important foes.

### Map Advice

The general advice that applies to picking maps for encounters applies here. Choose terrain that favors the creatures you add to the encounter, and give yourself some interesting elevation, cover, and terrain effects. If you're using a lot of creatures, be sure to give them space to move.

### Difficulty Modifier

This objective doesn't modify an encounter's difficulty.

### Success Condition

Choose one of the following success conditions:

- An encounter that includes two or more groups of minions ends when the heroes have no non-minion enemies remaining.
- An encounter with mostly horde creatures ends when the heroes outnumber their foes.
- An encounter with mostly platoon creatures ends when the heroes outnumber their foes two to one.
- The encounter ends when the number of remaining foes is half or less of what it was at the start.
- In a battle against a solo creature, that creature flees or surrenders when reduced to one-quarter or less of their Stamina and after using all their villain actions.

### Victories

If the heroes achieve success, they earn 1 Victory for an easy or standard encounter, or 2 Victories for a hard or extreme encounter.

### Failure Condition

The heroes earn no Victories if they are killed, captured, flee, or otherwise fail to defeat their foes.

### **Fleeing Foes**

When the heroes meet objective success conditions, many enemies know it's time to flee. It's a bad idea to make a habit of having enemies who get away come back with reinforcements to punish the heroes, because the players will soon learn to make every combat a slog to the bitter end. Most players and characters would rather see every enemy go down than let one get away if they know that foe will inevitably come back stronger.

Make it clear that if a foe is fleeing an encounter, it's because they don't want to face the heroes again. If you do plan to have a kobold gather reinforcements, have that little dragon swear vengeance and yell for help as they flee. That way, the players and the heroes all know that this particular kobold is a problem, but that other fleeing baddies can be safely ignored.

### **Defeat a Specific Foe**

An encounter built around defeating a specific foe includes one or more of the heroes' enemies commanding the rest, such as a hobgoblin bloodlord leading a group of mercenaries, or one or more particularly powerful foes among a group of weaker ones, such as a pair of tusker demons in a gnoll war band. Because these more-powerful enemies are the stars of the encounter, if only weak foes are left once the stars are gone, the battle loses its challenge and it's time to wrap it up. It makes sense for those weaker foes to flee or surrender once their strongest allies have gone down.

### Monster Roles and Organization

The specific foe you choose who must be defeated is likely a leader or a creature with a lot of Stamina for their level (such as a brute), or a creature of any role who is an elite or of a higher level than the heroes. It helps to give the specific foe a defender or two by their side and some minions to help make them harder to hit.

### Map Advice

When choosing a map for this type of encounter, consider the placement of the specific foe. You'll want to make sure that they're protected and not vulnerable to attacks on all sides. If they utilize ranged abilities, giving them the high ground and setting up a few choke points to make it difficult for the heroes to reach the foe makes for a good map.

If the specific foe is the type of enemy who likes to strike and retreat, make sure they have areas of cover or concealment to fall back to and a map that gives them plenty of space to move around. If they or their defenders use a lot of forced movement, make sure there are fun hazards and objects to throw heroes into. If you're worried about the characters being able to teleport in to attack, find a map with lots of walls or other barriers, since you need line of effect to your destination when you teleport.

It's also a good idea for the foe to have an escape route, often a choke point through which they can retreat. If the characters want to pursue, have the foe's allies hold them off-but don't make it impossible for the heroes to follow!

### Difficulty Modifier

If the creature or creatures who need to be taken down for the encounter to end make up one-third or less of the opposing side's total EV, then the encounter difficulty decreases by one level.

### Success Condition

The heroes win when the designated creature or creatures are reduced to 0 Stamina.

### Victories

Each hero earns 1 Victory for an easy or standard encounter, or 2 Victories for a hard encounter.

### Failure Condition

The heroes earn no Victories if they don't defeat all the designated creatures, including a scenario where designated creatures choose to flee if their allies all start dropping.

# **Get the Thing!**

Classic heroic fantasy is full of important objects that the heroes must protect from the forces of evil: magic rings, royal birth certificates, dragon eggs, and the like. Heroes often find themselves at violent odds with their enemies as they race to collect a valuable or important item from a guarded temple or castle, or when they need to steal the item from a group of enemies already in possession of it.

Objectives in this category work well when paired with other objectives, such as defeating a specific foe. For instance, the heroes must steal a ledger containing a record of criminal activity from an overmind and her lackeys. However, even if they obtain the ledger, the battle won't be over until they also defeat the overmind, who won't let the book go without a fight!

### The Thing

The thing the heroes need to get is typically a size 1T object. (If the thing is a creature or bulky object that must be carried past enemies, you might instead be looking at an Escort encounter.) Most or all routes leading to the thing are guarded by enemies, and a trap or a powerful monster often stands guard directly over the object. The thing might be fragile (for example, a paper document) or virtually unbreakable (a magic weapon). The heroes' enemies don't want to see it harmed, but the thing might be damaged accidentally.

Additionally, a thing can have one of the following extra defenses:

Hidden: The thing is hidden! The heroes need to make one or more successful tests to find it once they're at its location. Alternatively, it might be behind a door or in a sealed vessel that must be opened. Or it might even be hidden in plain sight, surrounded by multiple nearly identical things, so that an unassuming-looking sword held by a ceremonial suit of armor turns out to be the magic weapon the heroes need!

Held: As an especially potent defense, the thing might be possessed by an enemy. A relic or document might be in a villain's pocket, but if the thing is a weapon or implement, the enemy is likely to use it against characters seeking to take it.

### Monster Roles and Organization

This sort of encounter is all about getting in, grabbing an item, and then getting out. Guards protecting a thing are typically leaders, or other creatures with the brute or defender role. But you might instead have a hidden ambusher guarding the thing! Devious! Harriers and mounts make wonderful additions to these encounters, since they can chase after heroes who manage to obtain the thing. Likewise, controllers who can change or modify terrain, hexers who can slow down heroes, or minions who can clog up hallways can make fleeing with the thing difficult.

### Map Advice

The placement of the thing or the creature carrying it is important. Make sure the thing isn't simply hanging out in the middle of a wide-open space. Place it somewhere on a map where it's defended by hazards and choke points-and definitely not near an escape route! You'll also want to pick a big map for this type of encounter, since escaping with the thing is part of the challenge and small maps require less movement to achieve success.

### Difficulty Modifier

If there is no powerful monster (amounting to one-third or more of the encounter's total EV) or trap directly guarding the thing, the encounter is one difficulty category easier. If the thing is hidden or held, the encounter is one category harder.

### Success Condition

The heroes win when all the heroes leave the encounter map with the thing.

### Victories

If the heroes leave the map with the thing, each hero earns 1 Victory if the encounter was easy, standard, or hard. They instead earn 2 Victories if the success condition is met and the encounter was of extreme difficulty, or if none of the heroes took damage during an encounter of standard or higher difficulty.

### Failure Condition

The heroes earn no Victories if the thing is destroyed or remains in their enemies' possession.

### **Destroy the Thing!**

Combat doesn't always have to be about destroying your enemies. Sometimes it's about destroying their stuff! Burning a pirate captain's vessel, closing a portal to the Abyssal Wasteland before it lets in an army of demons, or shutting down a massive kobold trap made of spinning blades could so hamper the heroes' foes that the battle is no longer worth fighting once the damage is done.

Sometimes a thing in this kind of encounter is actually multiple things, all of which must be destroyed.

### The Thing

A typical thing is an object with Stamina equal to the heroes' level times 35. If the characters must destroy multiple things, divide the thing's Stamina between all of them. Most objects have poison and psychic immunity, and the thing might have immunity or weakness to one or more damage types. For instance, a magic statue might have immunity to fire damage and weakness to sonic damage.

Additionally, a thing can have one or more of the following extra defenses:

Hidden: The thing is hidden, requiring one or more successful tests by the heroes to locate it at its location. Alternatively, it might be behind a door or in a sealed vessel that must be opened, or hidden in plain sight among other similar things.

Held: The thing is possessed by an enemy, allowing a weapon or implement the characters seek to destroy to be used against them. A thing can't be both hidden and held.

Sturdy: The thing's Stamina is the heroes' level times 50.

Multiple: There are multiple things, all of which must be destroyed. Divide the thing's Stamina between all the individual things.

### Monster Roles and Organization

Encounters built around destroying a thing require beefy creatures to defend the thing-brutes and defenders, as well as squads of minions. It also helps to have a few artillery creatures off in the distance harassing heroes as they attempt to destroy the thing, so that melee heroes have to decide between fulfilling that goal while coming under fire or taking out the ranged attackers first. If the heroes want to use their own ranged abilities to destroy a thing from afar, a sneaky ambusher or two makes a delightful addition to the encounter, hanging back in the shadows waiting to pick opportunistic heroes off.

### Map Advice

The map placement of the thing to be destroyed is key, and it should be in a location that is easily protected and difficult for heroes to approach. It can be good to set up one or two hidden entrances to the area holding the thing, or even teleportation platforms or portals, so that monsters can enter the fray once the heroes get close to their target. Otherwise, the same choke points used to defend the object might prevent enemies from reaching the characters as they make quick work of the thing with minimal harassment. Smaller maps can work well for these kinds of encounters, as the heroes' enemies will have an easier time closing in around them.

### Difficulty Modifier

If the thing doesn't have any extra defenses (being hidden or held, having extra Stamina, and so forth), the encounter is one difficulty category easier. If the thing has two or more extra defenses, the encounter is one difficulty harder.

### Success Condition

The heroes win when they destroy the thing. In a multiple-thing setup, success might involve destroying only a certain number of the things.

### Victories

If the thing was destroyed, each hero earns 1 Victory for an easy or standard encounter, or 2 Victories for a hard encounter.

### Failure Condition

The heroes earn no Victories if the thing is not destroyed and remains under their enemies' control.

#### Save Another

No one earns the mantle of hero without saving a few lives. Sometimes the point of an encounter isn't to kill, but to save as many folks as you can. If the heroes rescue powerful allies from the clutches of their foes during combat, the added strength of those allies might be enough to make the remainder of the encounter trivial. When you and your companions save a griffon from a crew of poachers, the hunters become the... well, you know the rest.

### Allies and Potential Allies

Some encounters of this type feature willing allies-creatures able and willing to fight alongside the heroes. Others feature potential allies creatures who can't or won't join the heroes right away, but who might do so later in the battle. In combat, willing allies can be controlled by the heroes (and might use retainer stat blocks), while potential allies are controlled by you.

During an encounter, potential allies must be won over and freed from any captivity before they become allies, requiring a successful hard Presence test made as a maneuver. Potential allies otherwise attempt to flee the encounter on their turns.

### Monster Roles and Organization

Controllers and hexers make encounters based around saving others exciting. Their ability to hinder and put the whammy on heroes and bystanders alike greatly increases the challenge of keeping others alive. Likewise, harriers and mounts can chase down people fleeing the encounter, minions can cut off their escape routes, and artillery creatures can target them from afar. If noncombatants are captured at the start of the encounter, brutes make excellent hard-to-kill guardians.

### Map Advice

People who need saving by the heroes should be somewhere hard to reach, away from escape routes and protected by choke points that monsters can utilize. Make sure there's more than one route away from the fight, and that those routes are on different sides of the map. That way, freed noncombatants running off in different directions create a challenge for heroes trying to protect everyone at once. A map for an encounter of this type should also be big, since the noncombatants have to flee the area in order for the heroes to succeed. Make it challenging for them!

### Difficulty Modifier

For each willing ally the heroes have a chance to save who is their level or higher, add one hero to the party for the purpose of determining the encounter's difficulty.

### Success Condition

The heroes win if half or more of all willing allies and potential allies survived the encounter, and if all those creatures have been saved either joining the fight or having retreated off the encounter map.

### Victories

Each hero earns 1 Victory if the success condition was met and the encounter was easy or standard. Each hero earns 2 Victories if the success condition was met and the encounter was hard or extreme, or if all the creatures meant to be saved survived and the encounter is of standard or higher difficulty.

### Failure Condition

The heroes earn no Victories if more than half of the creatures meant to be saved were killed or captured during the encounter.

### **Escort**

Surprising as it may seem, sometimes the fate of the mission doesn't rest on the heroes' shoulders at all! Sometimes it rests on the shoulders of someone standing next to the heroes. The heroes' job is to keep this important person safe as they travel to a specific destination.

Not every escort encounter is on behalf of a wise or mighty ally. Sometimes the heroes are tasked with protecting a helpless or even an actively troublesome creature, such as a hapless noble or a wayward child. They might even have to protect a bulky or inconvenient inanimate object. Whatever the case, the enemies just keep coming until the heroes get their charge to their destination.

### Ward

The creature or object to be protected is called the ward. At the start of each combat round, the players decide which hero has responsibility for the ward. The ward moves on that hero's turn and is controlled by the hero's player. Creatures who are wards can take a move action or a maneuver on their turn, but not both. You determine a ward's characteristics and speed, with most humanoid wards having speed 5.

A sturdy ward, such as an active humanoid, typically has Stamina equal to 20 times the heroes' level. A delicate ward, such as an elderly diplomat or an important object, typically has Stamina equal to 10 times the heroes' level.

### Destination

Every encounter built around an escort mission has a destination: a place of safety beyond which enemies won't follow. When the encounter begins, the ward's distance from the destination should be at least three times the ward's speed (though they can start closer if difficult terrain or other obstacles complicate the route). The heroes' enemies can be placed anywhere on the encounter map, including between the ward and the destination, but not within 5 squares of the destination.

### Reinforcements

At the start of each combat round, any enemies who were killed during the previous round are replaced by a new group of creatures whose total EV is within 5 of the creatures lost. You choose the positions for these new creatures, none of which can start within 5 squares of the ward, the destination, or any hero.

### Monster Roles and Organization

Harriers and mounts can catch up with heroes as they attempt to reach the destination, while minions can take up space on the map to become mobile obstacles. When teamed up with support creatures who grant extra movement, harriers and mounts become ever more dangerous. Controllers are an excellent option for placing obstacles in the heroes' way, while hexers might be able to slow or pin down the ward. And an ambusher or two lying in wait on the way to the destination is never a bad choice!

### Map Advice

A map for an encounter of this type should be big, with lots of obstructions, cover, and hazards to make the journey interesting. The heroes shouldn't simply need to lead the ward down a road, but should have to climb cliffs, cross water or lava, fight through brambles, or pass through mazes of twisting corridors. If the ward has a damage weakness, you might set up a hazard or two that deals that damage type. If an escort mission takes place indoors, having a few dead ends where the heroes must retrace their route or run into monsters is always a great choice!

### Difficulty Modifier

An encounter built around protecting a delicate ward is one difficulty category harder.

### Success Condition

The heroes win when the ward reaches their destination.

### Victories

Each hero earns 1 Victory if the success condition is met. They earn 2 Victories if the success condition is met and the encounter's difficulty is extreme, or if the ward and all the heroes reach their destination in 3 rounds or less and the encounter is of standard or higher difficulty.

### Failure Condition

The heroes earn no Victories if the ward is reduced to 0 Stamina or is prevented from reaching their destination.

# **Hold Them Off**

Sometimes the heroes just need to buy time. They might need to battle a conquering tyrant's army to allow innocent villagers time to escape. They might need to hold off wave after wave of zombies while a group of priests completes a ritual to lay the undead to rest for good. To achieve this objective, the heroes need to stay alive and protect a particular position for a number of rounds determined by you.

### Defensive Position

Often with the input of the players, you choose a defensive position-an area that must be held and controlled by the heroes. Enemies attempt to get through the defensive position or to reach a certain point in or around it, so that the fewer enemies who do so, the better the heroes' chances of success. The area can be any size, with the defensive position often blocking entry to a vulnerable area the heroes are defending.

A defensive position might grant benefits to the heroes defending it. The approach to the position might be a choke point, involve crossing difficult terrain, or require climbing. Anyone inside the position might have the benefit of high ground against anyone outside it.

If you want to increase the difficulty of the encounter, you might have two or more defensive positions the heroes must defend, such as two openings in a canyon pass that both lead to the same defenseless village.

### Encounter Duration

An encounter focused on a defensive position has a fixed duration determined by you-the number of rounds the heroes must defend the area in order to be successful. A typical encounter duration is 3 rounds.

### Reinforcements

At the end of each combat round, you add more enemies to the map for the heroes to battle. These reinforcements appear 10 squares or more away from the defensive position. Each new group of enemies should have an EV equal to that of all the enemies who got past the heroes during the previous round, plus the EV of one hero (see Step-by-Step Encounter Building earlier in this section). If you don't spend all the EV for the new group, the remainder can be added to reinforcements in a future round.

### Monster Roles and Organization

This type of encounter can be a lot of fun, with creatures of all roles entering the battle in new configurations of reinforcements each combat round to keep heroes on their toes. Use controller creatures to change up terrain and force move the heroes out of position. Ambushers, harriers, and mounts have the best chance of slipping by the heroes, especially if they come organized as minions or a horde. Artillery creatures can harass the heroes from afar, forcing them to leave their defensive position. Leaders and support creatures are great for these encounters, as they grant their allies extra movement and attacks to harass heroes and force them out of position.

To ensure an encounter of this type remains fair for the heroes, you'll want to only occasionally use monsters who can fly, burrow, or teleport.

### Map Advice

A good map for this encounter has a defensive position featuring at least two openings, each of which is 3 squares wide or more. The defensive position shouldn't be so wide-open that the heroes can't possibly defend it, but it shouldn't be so small that they can too easily lock it down. The approach to the defensive position should include areas of cover so that monsters aren't just charging up a hill at the heroes. You'll want a map large enough that monsters can't rush the heroes and overwhelm them, but not so large that it takes enemies 3 rounds just to reach the defensive position.

### Difficulty Modifier

The difficulty of an encounter built around holding off an enemy is determined by the creatures present for the battle at the start of the first combat round. Don't count reinforcements toward the difficulty. The encounter difficulty is one category harder if the encounter duration is 5 rounds or greater, or if there are three or more defensive positions.

### Success Condition

The heroes win if they survive for the encounter duration and allow fewer creatures through or into the defensive position than the number of heroes who started the encounter, including any retainers on the heroes' side.

### Victories

Each hero earns 1 Victory if the success condition is met. They earn 2 Victories if the success condition is met and the encounter's difficulty is extreme, or if the party held off the enemy for an encounter duration of 5 rounds or more and the encounter is of standard or higher difficulty

### Failure Condition

The heroes earn no Victories if a number of creatures equal to or greater than the number of starting heroes get through the defensive position or into the desired areas in or around it.

### **Assault the Defenses**

The enemy holds a strategically important position and the heroes want it. The encounter ends when the heroes secure the objective defensive location for themselves, even if there are more enemies outside it. Sometimes an encounter with this objective is part of a combined objective, as when heroes must first assault the defenses, then hold that defensive position against counterattack.

### Defensive Position


You choose the defensive position, setting up an area that must be captured by the heroes. The area can be of any size. Not all of the heroes' enemies in the encounter are in the defensive position, with some outside it attempting to stop the characters before they get close.

Often, a defensive position grants benefits to its defenders. The approach to the position might feature a number of choke points, areas of difficult terrain, or sections that require climbing or swimming. Anyone inside the defensive position might have the benefit of high ground against anyone outside it.

### Monster Roles and Organization

Defensive positions benefit from having an outside patrol of defenders and brutes protecting the site, and supporting some combination of artillery, controllers, and hexers who hit the heroes hard as they approach. A support creature or a leader can benefit all other enemies, helping them do a better job of keeping the heroes hampered and away.

### Map Advice

A good "Assault the Defenses" map shares the same qualities as a good "Hold Them Off" map (above), with the roles of the heroes and their enemies reversed.

### Difficulty Modifier

An encounter of this type has a difficulty one category harder if the defensive position grants two or more distinct benefits to its defenders.

### Success Condition

The heroes win when one or more heroes and none of their enemies have been in the defensive position for 4 consecutive turns.

### Victories

Each hero earns 1 Victory if the success condition is met, or 2 Victories if the success condition is met and the encounter's difficulty is hard or extreme.

### Failure Condition

The heroes fail only if they are unable to achieve the success condition.

# **Stop the Action**

Sometimes combat is complicated by the fact that the heroes need to stop the villainous actions of their foes. It's not enough to simply defeat the warriors in a cult. The heroes must also stop the zealots' devil-summoning ritual! Or it might be that the heroes need to interrupt a wedding and make sure an evil mage doesn't marry the heir to the throne. Despite combat, the mage forces the ceremony to continue! Objectives in this category have a timer associated with them. If the heroes don't achieve the objective in a certain number of rounds, the conditions of the battle could well change. For instance, if the cultists summon a devil high judge, defeating the devil suddenly becomes the heroes' new objective!

### Encounter Duration

An encounter focused on stopping others' actions has a fixed duration determined by you-the number of rounds before the villains complete their plans. A typical encounter duration is 3 rounds, but events might change the encounter duration. For example, a character might succeed on a hard Reason test to dispute a wedding's legality and increase the encounter duration by 1, while failing to stop zealots from sacrificing an innocent creature as part of their ritual might decrease the duration by 1.

### Stopping the Action

The enemies' evil plans have certain requirements, and if those requirements aren't met, the action is stopped and the heroes are victorious. For instance, to complete a ritual, one or more zealot priests might be required to spend a main action each combat round to continue the ritual. A wedding or other official ceremony can't be completed if a participant or officiant is killed or captured.

### Failure Consequences

If the enemies' plans succeed, additional consequences might unfold within the encounter. For instance, if zealots summon a demon, or if a newly crowned evil mage uses their royal authority to summon guards, the heroes could face extra enemies. These potential reinforcements aren't counted toward the encounter's difficulty, since they appear only once the heroes have failed the encounter. This is an entirely new battle now!

### Monster Roles and Organization

The roles that best fit this type of encounter depend on the action the heroes are trying to stop. But if them doing so involves destroying, capturing, or reaching one or more creatures or objects, then brutes and defenders make an excellent choice for keeping the characters away. Artillery and harriers also make good choices for being able to target heroes no matter where they move on the map.

### Map Advice

An ideal map for this type of encounter depends on the action the heroes are trying to stop, but it shouldn't be easy for them to reach the places they need to go in order to complete that objective. Hazardous terrain, walls, and other forms of cover mean that heroes can't just waltz up to creatures or objects that are part of the action to be stopped and neutralize them.

### Difficulty Modifier

The difficulty of this type of encounter is one category harder if the encounter duration is 2 rounds or less, and one category easier if the action can be stopped by killing or otherwise neutralizing any one creature.

### Success Condition

The heroes win if they stop the action before the encounter duration is up.

### Victories

Each hero earns 1 Victory if the success condition is met. They earn 2 Victories if the success condition is met and the encounter's difficulty is extreme, or if the heroes stop the action before the last round of the encounter duration and the encounter is of standard or higher difficulty.

### Failure Condition

The heroes earn no Victories if they fail to stop the action before the end of the encounter duration. They might earn Victories from any new encounters that occur because of a failure.

### **Under Pressure**

If the heroes have been saving the day faster than you expected, it might be time to see how fast they truly are! Encounters built around the objective of stopping an action or completing an action work well in tandem with the other objectives in this section. The heroes might need to diminish enemy numbers or defeat a specific foe within 2 rounds or lose their opportunity to infiltrate the palace. Maybe an escort mission needs to reach the destination within 3 rounds to contain a devastating explosion! See Combined Objectives for more details.

There is no visible text in the image, only a geometric shape (a diamond inside an angled line).

### **Complete the Action**

This encounter objective sees the characters charged with initiating an event, performing a ritual, and so forth. For instance, if the heroes are attempting to launch an airship while repelling a time raider boarding party, the encounter could be over the moment the heroes manage to activate the vessel and take off with just a few time raiders actually aboard.

### Encounter Duration

An encounter focused on completing a specific action has a fixed duration determined by you-the number of rounds within which the heroes must complete their plans. A typical encounter duration is 3 rounds.

### Tasks and Failures

In each combat round, half or more of the heroes must use a maneuver to perform a task that advances their plans. You decide what tasks are available and where they must be performed. For instance, to launch an airship, one hero might have to cast off an anchor on deck while another unfurls a sail at the top of a mast. The list of available tasks can change each turn, as you determine. For more difficult encounters, performing a task might require a successful test.

At the end of any combat round in which the heroes have failed to perform the required number of tasks, the party accumulates one failure.

### Monster Roles and Organization

Since stopping and knocking around heroes is the name of their game, controllers and hexers make excellent choices to prevent characters from completing an action, especially when backed up and bolstered by support creatures. You can also put brutes in the way of the heroes and pepper in ambushers who can harass them and then dance away.

### Map Advice

The best map for this type of encounter depends on the action the heroes are trying to complete. The places they need to reach to perform tasks shouldn't be right next to each other, and moving through the area should be relatively complicated.

### Difficulty Modifier

The difficulty of this type of encounter is one category harder if the encounter duration is 5 or more, or if completing tasks requires a successful test. It is one category easier if the encounter duration is 2 or less.

### Success Condition

The heroes win if they reach the end of the encounter duration with 1 or no failures.

### Victories

Each hero earns 1 Victory if the success condition is met. They earn 2 Victories if the success condition is met and the encounter's difficulty is extreme, or if they reach the end of the encounter duration with zero failures and the encounter is of standard or higher difficulty.

### Failure Condition

The heroes earn no Victories and can't complete the action if they accumulate 2 or more failures during the encounter duration.

### **Combined Objectives**

Some encounters have multiple objectives that must all be accomplished. For instance, the heroes might need to break down prison gates (a "Destroy the Thing" encounter) and then battle the guards while prisoners escape (a "Hold Them Off" encounter). The prisoners can't escape while the gates stand, and breaking the gates is useless if the prisoners don't escape, so it's all or nothing! To win the encounter, the heroes must meet the success conditions for each of the encounter's combined objectives. And if they succeed, each hero earns Victories as appropriate for each encounter.

### **Alternative Objectives**

Many encounters can be completed successfully in several ways. If the heroes are fighting an evil emperor channeling the power of a magic crown, they might win by killing or capturing the emperor ("Defeat a Specific Foe"), breaking or stealing the crown ("Destroy the Thing" or "Get the Thing"), or even by negotiating a detente with the emperor's forces.

If an encounter has multiple alternative objectives, you reward the heroes for the objective they completed the most successfully. For instance, if the heroes steal the emperor's crown, it doesn't matter that they didn't meet the success conditions for the other objectives-they still achieve success.

### **Changing Objectives**

The heroes might start an encounter with one objective, only to have you change things up with an unexpected shot of dramatic tension. For instance, the characters are battling it out with a demon lord to end that creature's reign of terror-a "Defeat a Specific Foe" objective. Then they suddenly notice the demon's cultists preparing to sacrifice a group of innocent noncombatants, changing the objective to "Save Another." When an objective shifts, make sure the players understand there's now something else at stake. As long as the innocents are saved, it no longer matters if the demon lord lives.

### **Changing or Adding Objectives**

If you find that the heroes are having an exceptionally easy time taking on an encounter, you can always have a dramatic twist in the middle of the battle that leads to an additional objective and changes their current goal. Don't have this kind of surprise in every battle, but much like using reinforcements, changing or adding objectives is a tactic you can lean on when an encounter you meant to be hard turns out to be trivial.

# Running Encounters

Once you've built a combat encounter, it's time to run it! Keeping the following tips in mind can help make your encounters fun and dynamic.

### **Use Stat Blocks as Written**

Monster stat blocks in *Draw Steel* are designed to be effective. Most of the time, if you use the main actions and maneuvers in a creature's stat block, that creature will do what you need them to do in a fight.

### **Remember Default Maneuvers**

Non-minion creatures can use a main action AND a maneuver on their turn, while minions can choose between one or the other. If a creature doesn't have a maneuver in their stat block, remember that they can always use the Grab, Hide, or Knockback maneuvers (see Chapter 10: Combat in *Draw Steel: Heroes*), just like the heroes can!

#### Keep Creatures Moving

If you want a dynamic combat, trust that the heroes will move in response to the monsters moving. Move your creatures to let them take advantage of flanking, get out of range of the heroes' abilities, and focus on vulnerable targets.

#### Spread the Damage Around

In an encounter with a lot of creatures, it's tempting to focus fire on a single hero. This can be a good tactical move, but it's not always fun for the players. Many heroes have triggered actions they can use when they take damage, so spreading the damage around can give those heroes a chance to do a cool thing off turn.

#### Modify Stamina As You See Fit

Do you really want that foe to live for one more round? Give them a little extra Stamina! Is combat starting to drag? Look at that, every creature you control now has just 1 Stamina remaining. Of all the numbers in a monster's stat block, Stamina is the one you can freely adjust to serve the needs of the encounter.

#### Utilize Reinforcements

It can be tough to manage a lot of creatures at once in combat, but bringing in new waves of creatures allows you to use a lot of different stat blocks in an encounter without getting overwhelmed by trying to run all of them at once. Reinforcements can also make an encounter that initially seems like a cakewalk suddenly feel much more deadly as the stakes are raised!

# **Play Nice-Even If You Don't Play Fair**

It might be tempting to keep a flying monster far out of reach of the heroes, or popping that third villain action at the start of combat, or causing rocks to fall from the sky every turn. But the less the heroes can do about any specific situation, the less involved your players will feel in the game. Use any tricks you can think of to make combat exciting and challenge the players, but make sure that challenges can always be overcome.

# **Choose Your Ending**

You can end combat with a dramatic finish, which lets the heroes get in on the narrative fun, or an event ending. See Chapter 10: Combat in *Draw Steel: Heroes* for more information.

### **Allow Heroes to Flee**

If the heroes decide to abandon a fight they can't win, you can have them escape using a montage test, or simply describe them running away so as to live to fight another day. Do whatever you think will be the most fun for the players after a defeat.

### **Optional Rule: Last-Stand Stamina**

For players who like to have their characters duke it out to the bitter end rather than ending combat early, this optional rule can help you bring things to a quicker conclusion. When it's clear that the heroes are going to win a battle, their enemies are overcome with fear, despair, and panic. In this demoralized state, each enemy's Stamina drops to 1, and each minion squad's Stamina pool is now equal to the number of minions in the squad. The heroes can then make short work of any remaining foes, getting the satisfaction of total annihilation via dice rolls.

## Reskinning Monsters

Even with a book chock full of monsters, you're likely to find yourself wishing you had stat blocks for a specific kind of creature not presented in this book or another monster supplement. You might need snake people, fish people, or a 50-story-tall crab. The good news is that you can modify any of the stat blocks in this book to make new creatures with just a little work!

Use the following tips for reskinning monsters for your game:

- Description: You can change any creature's description and use their stat block as-is to create something new. If you want a weretiger instead of a werewolf, odds are that simply describing the werewolf as a tiger-humanoid hybrid and mentally swapping the word "wolf" with "tiger" when you play will get you what you need without changing anything else. Whenever you find an existing creature whose stats are already quite close to what you want, this process is especially easy.
- Movement and Environment: Giving a creature the ability to climb or swim at full speed while moving doesn't change their level or challenge. Neither does giving them an aquatic origin or the ability to breathe underwater. You can make these sorts of changes freely to create new mountainous or aquatic variants of different stat blocks, turning demonic gnolls into rampaging fishfolk or cavern-climbing horrors with ease!
- Damage Types: You can change damage types for abilities, immunities, and weaknesses easily. Transforming an elemental crux of fire into a crux of acid can be done by swapping all references to fire damage in the stat block to acid damage.
- Modifiable Stat Blocks: The stat blocks in the Animals and Rivals sections of this book are meant to be modified, and those sections feature rules for creating new animal and humanoid stat blocks. You can use these stat blocks to create nearly any creature who falls into either of those categories, including many creatures common to fantasy.

# Adjusting Monster Levels

Each monster in this book was created with the help of handcrafted tables of numbers and the extensive monster-making rules developed for *Draw Steel*. As such, stat blocks aren't intended to be modified or adjusted (with the exception of animals and rivals, as noted above). Your best bet for adjusting any given monster is to find another monster of the level, organization, and role you're looking for, and reskinning that monster while using their statistics.

That said, this section provides formulas you can use to get close to the appropriate EV for a monster of a level you want to create if no stat block feels suitable for reskinning, or if you want a sense of how *Draw Steel* monsters work.

### **Role, Organization, and Damage Modifier**

The following two tables detail how a monster's role and organization affects the numbers in their stat block. These modifiers can be plugged into formulas presented below, along with a monster's expected level.

| Role/Organization | Role Modifier | Damage Modifier |
|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Ambusher          | +20           | +1              |
| Artillery         | +10           | +1              |
| Brute             | +30           | +1              |
| Controller        | +10           | +0              |
| Defender          | +30           | +0              |
| Harrier           | +20           | +0              |
| Hexer             | +10           | +0              |
| Mount             | +20           | +0              |
| Support           | +20           | +0              |
| Elite*            | +0            | +1              |

| Solo              | +30           | +2              |

\*Elite can be used in conjunction with a role that features a +1 damage modifier, for a total damage modifier of +2.

# **Encounter Value and Stamina**

A monster's EV is calculated using the following equation. (The EV for minions represents four minions together.) Round up results to the nearest whole number.

### **((2 x Level) + 4) x Organization Modifier**

Monster Stamina can be approximated using the following equation. Round up results to the nearest whole number.

### **((10 x Level) + Role Modifier) x Organization Modifier**

If you want your non-minion monster to have additional Stamina, you can add (**3 x Level) + 3** to their total.

#### Damage and Power Roll Tiers

The baseline damage dealt by a monster's abilities can be approximated using the following equation. Round up all results to the nearest whole number.

**(4 + Level + Damage Modifier) x Tier Modifier**

For horde and minion monsters, divide this result by 2.

If the ability is a strike, add the monster's highest characteristic to the total.

The tier modifier uses a different value for each power roll tier.

```
Tier 1 = 0.6
Tier 2 = 1.1
Tier 3 = 1.4
```
At higher levels, these values can lead to damage numbers a few points higher than those seen in this book.

#### Characteristics and Abilities

Additional rules cover a monster's characteristics and additional modi fications to their abilities:

- A monster's highest characteristic and power roll bonus is equal to 1 + their echelon. For example, a level 5 goblin (2nd echelon) has a +3 for their highest characteristic.
- A monster who uses potencies in their abilities bases those potencies on their highest characteristic, minus 1 for each tier below tier 3. With a +3 characteristic for our level 5 goblin, their signature ability uses potency language of m<1] at tier 1, m<2] at tier 2, and m<3] at tier 3.
- If a monster is a leader or a solo, increase their highest characteristic and power roll by 1 (to a maximum of +5), and increase their potency values at all tiers by 1 (to a maximum of 6).
- A monster's free strike damage is equal to the damage calculated for a tier 1 outcome for an ability.
- Monster abilities normally target one creature or object. Elite, leader, and solo monsters have abilities that typically target two creatures or objects.
- If you want a monster's ability to target one additional target over what's expected, multiply the damage at all tiers by 0.8. If an ability targets two or more additional targets, multiply the damage by 0.5. If an ability targets one fewer target than expected, multiply the damage by 1.2.
- Plenty more considerations regarding a monster's features and abilities go into creating a new monster. More robust guidance for making new monsters and abilities will appear in the future.

# Ajax the Invincible

"On behalf of the college, I would like to thank Lord Alvaro for his excellent lecture. The whole school owes you a debt for donating your time today. We will now open the floor to questions. Before we do, I would like to remind you that we enjoy a certain amount of informality here at the war college, but when speaking to Lord Alvaro, let not informality topple over into *familiarity.* We will take the first question now. Francis?"

"Thank you, sir. Lord Alvaro, what we just heard on the topic of Ajax's strategy was pretty chilling. In your opinion, as someone who knew him, how serious is he with his stance on non-humans in Orden? And how should we reconcile this with the treaties he signed with the elves and dwarves of Vasloria? Thank you for your time, my lord."

"Ah, yes," Alvaro said, eyebrows raised theatrically. "Jack's famous 'pro-human' rhetoric." And there was a susurration among the students. For the last hour, Lord Alvaro had only referred to the subject of his lecture as "Ajax." Everyone in the city knew Ajax and Alvaro attended university together, but for the first time, the students in the lecture hall understood-they had been *friends*.

"The short answer is: no. I don't believe Jack is a raving ah... 'human supremacist,' as the broadsheets put it. That's Mortum. But he does find the idea *useful*.

"I spoke for the last hour on Jack's *tactics*. But let's talk about his high-level goals for a moment. Remember everything I just said about Vasloria. The unique problems it presents to someone like Jack. Vasloria is probably as complex a problem as Ajax will ever face. No centralized government, no infrastructure. There's no Vaslorian equivalent of the Heliopolis, or Capital, Kashiato, or Qarat al Ya'tib. So how does one *conquer* a region with no unified identity and no central command?

"Well, you *create* that identity. Consider, before the coming of Ajax, most humans in the region only knew the elves and dwarves as a source of trade! Commerce. Large-scale battles were mostly fought between human duchies.

"Ajax systematically *defeats* those dukes, replacing them with... no one, and he forces the elves and dwarves to sign treaties at swordpoint. Like the dwarves of Kal Kalavar. They pay tribute to Ajax in forced labor. They don't send *dwarves*, oh no! They capture *humans*. Those unsuited for labor go into the Body Banks.

"So, what has Jack done? He's chopped the head off the feudal system in Vasloria leaving only far-flung baronies to fend for themselves. The people feel scared, alone. Leaderless. If the people use the roads, they risk capture by the dwarves; if they use the woods for resources, they're cut down by the elves. So they learn to *distrust* the elves and dwarves.

"I think it's a stroke of genius. *Conquering* all of Vasloria by force would be a long and bloody affair. Instead, he creates the conditions that will allow him to *save* Vasloria. He lets this field lie fallow for a few years, and, when he returns, there'll be a whole generation of young people who do not remember a time when the roads or forests were safe. Who *hate* the dwarves and elves. When Ajax returns, they will welcome him as their protector and he will unite them *against* these new enemies.

"It's a long plan, but I can't see any way it won't work. Uniting humans by pitting them against everyone else in Orden is a strategy I think he'll rely on more and more. It's working very well for him. Next question."

"Lord Alvaro, according to the broadsheets, there are many new churches in Vasloria dedicated to 'Saint' Ajax. Do you believe this is part of his grand strategy? Thank you, my lord."

"That's Mortum's doing, I'm sure of it. Mortum was a great believer in the power of religion as a tool to manipulate societies. If Jack's given it any thought at all, he'd see it as a sound strategy for his plan to return as, not just the protector, but the *savior* of the land. I suspect if Mortum hadn't pushed the idea, Jack would have thought of it sooner or later. The Pharoah of Khemhara commands *enormous* power, more than any political leader in all Orden, because uniquely he is both head of state and the chief religious officer. Even the emperors of Caelila didn't think of that. Next question."

"Thank you. Lord Alvaro, *if* Ajax is trying to conquer the world... do you think he will succeed?"

"Yes. Unless there's rapid agreement between all the powers of the world to work together and stop him? Yes, he's going to win. It's precisely because he knew such an alliance of powers was practically impossible that he even considered a Caelian-style campaign of conquest in the first place.

"Next question."

# On Ajax

He bestrides the land like one of history's great conquerors. A combination of ambition, courage, and study created a master tactician in command of a massive army collecting countless priceless treasures-and no one to stand in his way.

### **By Might and Merit**

Ajax the Invincible has earned his title. He graduated top of his class at Capital's military academy, and then immediately launched into a campaign across his homeland of Phaedros. At his side was his advisor Mortum, a nefarious wizard who guided Ajax in the footsteps of the Caelian Empire's conquests before them.

Together, Ajax and Mortum went on to subjugate and enlist hamlet after town after city after territory with little standing in their way. When they successfully returned the Chrysopolis-an ancient flying sky-elf city-to the sky, and their accomplishments literally rose above the country-no one could ignore their might any longer.

### **Treasures Abound**

Ajax lays claims to many powerful treasures, both gifted to him in exchange for sanctuary and taken by his own hands. The Mantle of the Phoenix Queen, a harness that conjures the wings of a phoenix. Uthgryl, the Negotiator, Blade of the Gol King, a sword so sharp that it could cleave a person's willpower in two. The Hand of Kukai, a gauntlet plated in jade that harbors powerful, forbidden magic.

His arsenal is vast and strategically picked to round out his strength. There are few situations he isn't prepared to handle.

### **The Iron Saint**

While some of his forces may refer to Ajax as the Iron Saint, the version of him presented here hasn't taken up that title yet. Ajax the Invincible will continue to amass followers, treasures, and titles until he can ascend to his rightful status as a saint. It's up to the heroes to make sure this will never come to pass.

### **Ajax's Languages**

Ajax speaks Caelian, Higaran, Khoursirian, Phaedran, Riojan, Vaniric, and Vaslorian.

### **Ajax the Leader**

Ajax is a master tactician. It would stand to reason that he can enter battle leading an army instead of facing the heroes solo.

Future adventures might feature different iterations and stat blocks for Ajax. For now, you can convert Ajax the Invincible into a level 11 leader with the following adjustments:

- ¥Reduce his encounter value to EV 52.
- ¥Reduce his Stamina to 280.
- ¥Remove his **Ajax Turns** trait.
- ¥Remove all his maneuvers.
- ¥Add the following maneuver:

**Strike Them Down** Two allies within 10 squares of Ajax each move up to their speed and can use a signature ability.

¥Adjust the **I'm Not Done Yet** trait so that Ajax dies at −140 Stamina instead of −350.

### **Tactical Stance Ajax Feature**

At the start of each round, Ajax chooses a new stance from one of the following options and gains its benefits:

### t **Insurgent**

Ajax automatically treats his initial power roll as a 17. He can still roll to determine if he scores a critical hit.

### t **Mastermind**

Before he uses an ability, Ajax can either shift up to 2 squares, or can cause one creature within line of effect to slide up to 2 squares, ignoring stability.

### t **Vanguard**

Ajax has damage immunity 5. Additionally, any enemy who makes a power roll that includes Ajax as a target has a double bane on the roll.

### **Ajax's Malice Malice Features**

At the start of Ajax's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

### s **Reason 2 Malice**

Ajax attempts to instill doubt into a creature within line of effect through logic and reason. The creature and Ajax make an opposed Reason test. If Ajax wins, he chooses to either deal 11 extra damage to one target on his next strike or to gain an additional triggered action during the current round. Ajax can't use this feature against the same creature during the same encounter.

### p **Nexus Jewel 5 Malice**

Until the end of the round, Ajax chooses one of the following environments he has previously visited and overlays that environment on top of the encounter map, temporarily merging multiple realities.

Incredibly High Above the Ground: The winds whip and bluster. Any creature who can't fly takes a −3 penalty to stability, and forced movement effects gain a +3 bonus to their distance against such creatures.

Swamp: The ground is difficult terrain for enemies. Any creature who starts and ends their turn in the same space is restrained (save ends).

Volcanic Canyon: The air is stiflingly hot. Each enemy takes 5 fire damage for each square they enter.

d **Solo Action 5 Malice** Ajax takes an additional main action on his turn. He can use this feature even if he is dazed.

### a **Draw Steel 10 Malice**

Area, Magic, Ranged, Weapon Main action e Four 3 cubes within 10 x Each enemy and object in the area

**Effect:** Each target makes a test using their highest characteristic.

- 1 26 damage; bleeding and slowed (save ends)
- 2 22 damage; bleeding (save ends)
- 3 16 damage

Ajax then raises his Blade of the Gol King above his head as four giant blades emerge from the ground to fill the area. Each target is pushed into an unoccupied space adjacent to the area after the power roll is resolved. Each blade blocks line of effect and can be dismissed by Ajax at will (no action required).

### d **Ajax**

Ajax Turns: Ajax takes up to three turns each round. He can't take turns consecutively. Additionally, he can use three triggered actions in a round while he isn't dazed.

End **Effect:** At the end of each of his turns, Ajax can take 20 damage to end up to two effects on him that can be ended by a saving throw. This damage can't be reduced in any way.

# ANGULOTLS

Found in freshwater swamps, rivers, and rainforests, angulotls (angwa-LAH-tuls) are diminutive, brightly colored amphibious humanoids. Rather than defending their settlements and breeding grounds against hostile creatures, these poisonous frog folk prefer to establish their homes in places that are nigh-impossible for other humanoids to find, such as underwater caves and other enclosed spaces accessible only by water. Angulotls are happy to hide and watch a gaggle of noisy adventurers stumble past the entrance to their clutch without realizing it. But though they prefer to avoid combat, whenever they're threatened or pressed, angulotls can turn deadly.

#### Deadly Toxins

Angulotls are poisonous creatures, which suits their preference to avoid aggression-because they don't need it! The contact toxin secreted by their skin gives them an edge in close combat, and they also distill this toxin into more potent forms for coating blades and tipping darts.

### **Indicator Species**

Angulotl physiology is delicately balanced, and it doesn't take much to upset that balance. While toxins don't kill them, they are still affected by pollutants in their waters. Ongoing contamination of their environment can corrupt angulotls, making them aggressive, confused, and angry. Most pollution-corrupted angulotls eventually attack any creature who crosses their path-even other angulotls! Runoff from magical experimentation seems to affect them the most-and sometimes grants them strange abilities.

### **Moisture Dependent**

Angulotls breathe through their skin, so they need to stay damp or they suffocate. They often avoid travel in dry areas, and they prefer not to stray far from sources of freshwater unless it's raining.

### **Clawfish**

Known as q'ukutxal (koo-OOK-oot-shaal) to angulotls, the clawfish resembles a moray eel with eight reptilian legs. These small animals can slither through grass and clamber up trees nearly as well as they glide through river currents. Angulotls train them not only to pull rafts, but to cleverly fight by grabbing and electrocuting foes.

### **Angulotl Languages**

Most angulotls speak Filliaric.

### **Wet**

Angulotls make use of a unique effect called "wet." While wet, an angulotl doesn't provoke opportunity attacks by moving. At the same time, any non-angulotl who is wet and ends their turn with none of their movement remaining slips and falls prone. Several angulotl abilities can impose this effect, but a creature in an encounter featuring angulotls can also become wet by entering water, as the Director determines.

### **Angulotl Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any angulotl's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

### t **Leapfrog 3 Malice**

Until the end of the round, when an angulotl moves through an inactive angulotl's space, the inactive angulotl can use a free triggered action to jump 3 squares.

### b **Resonating Croak 5 Malice**

Each angulotl in the encounter puffs out their throat and starts loudly droning Any non-angulotl adjacent to an angulotl makes an **Intuition test.**

- 1 5 sonic damage; slowed (EoT)
- 2 4 sonic damage
- 3 No effect.

p **Rainfall 7 Malice** An angulotl calls clouds to cover the encounter map and unleash rain until the end of the round. Any creature or object that is exposed to the sky is wet until the end of the encounter.

# They like humans! Adults tend to freak them out a little. I don't think they realize tall humans are the same species as tiny humans!

| **Effect:** A bubble of toxic gas fills the area, ready to pop. If any creature or object touches the bubble or if the bubble takes damage, it bursts.

### t **Toxiferous**

Whenever an adjacent enemy grabs the wave or uses a melee ability against them, that enemy takes 2 poison damage.

### **Angulotl Tactics**

Angulotls are not generally aggressive, and if confronted, a patrol of frog folk will usually exchange a few blows before performing a harrying retreat to their hidden villages. In defense of their homes, however, they become much fiercer and more determined. In these battles, angulotls try to force fights in or near water to take advantage of their amphibious nature and the wet effect.

Simple patrols are usually made up of slippery captains leaping into the backline and harassing low-Stamina heroes while their minion hordes keep higher-Stamina heroes engaged. In larger engagements their tactics become more defensive to protect their high-value units. They tend to stay in close and coherent groups to take advantage of support abilities.

e Special x Special

**Effect:** The encounter map dries up and each enemy and object on it is illuminated until the end of the encounter. An illuminated creature or object can't hide or become invisible, and any strike made against an illuminated target gains an edge. Additionally, each enemy in the encounter who is wet has that effect end and takes 6 acid damage. Each angulotl in the encounter has a double edge on their next strike.

### t **Toxiferous**

Whenever an adjacent enemy grabs the daybringer or uses a me lee ability against them, that enemy takes 3 poison damage.

# ANIMALS

The natural denizens of every world, animals ferocious, atrocious, and precocious roam the lands between and among settlements of humanoids and other folk. Whether they graze or hunt, stay solitary or move in packs, fight danger or fly from it, all animals share a singular goal-to live. Most animals are not monsters, but some are twisted by magic and malice to *become* monsters. A hero wouldn't mercilessly kill a pack of hungry wolves-but they'll slay rot-magic dire wolves created by vampires. In many cases, animals are more likely to be bystanders than threats in an encounter.

# Animal Traits

This section presents a number of default animal stat blocks with basic features. You can customize those stat blocks by adding traits from the following categories to more closely model the animal's most identifiable features. You can spend up to 4 points on traits to add to a stat block without increasing the encounter value. Each point you spend after 4 increases the stat block's EV by 2. Unless otherwise specified, you can select a trait only once.

#### Mobility Traits

Mobility traits cover a wide range of the options that keep animals moving.

######## Burrowing (2 Points)

The animal can burrow.

**+1 Point:** The animal can burrow through stone, creating a tunnel of their size in each square of stone they move through.

**+1 Point:** The animal can also hover.

**Typically Used By:** Bees, birds.

######## Leaping (2 Points)

When using animal traits, think about using one mobility trait and either a defensive or an offensive trait to capture the sense of the animal. Other animal traits that don't need to be on the stat block can emerge naturally through gameplay, such as a cat taking no damage from a fall.

# **Defensive Traits**

Defensive traits help animals stay out of danger-or to set ambushes for unwary prey.

### **Animal Stat Blocks**

The following stat blocks can be used to describe everyday animals capable of acting as threats or challenges to the heroes under appropriate circumstances. Alternatively, you can add traits to these stat blocks to describe animals of a specific type. If you're adding traits to animal stat blocks, build out your custom animals ahead of time to lessen the amount of flipping back and forth between stat blocks and traits during play.

### **Animal Notation**

When building an animal by adding traits to a stat block, you can use a shorthand to describe the animal. For example, a dire wolf might be denoted as "Predator B: Swiftness, Pack, Hunter" to indicate that you're using the Predator B stat block with the Swiftness, Pack, and Hunter traits.

The Example Animals table breaks out a number of animals using this notation. Selected traits are listed in order by category-mobility, defensive, offensive, and supernatural.

### **Can I Make a Harmless Animal?**

You certainly can! Animal traits can be applied to the **noncombatant** stat block to make unimposing animals the heroes can rescue (see Harmless Creatures in the Introduction section). Surviving a wild animal attack can also be handled through group tests and montage tests as if those animals were environmental challenges to overcome rather than individual threats.

### ! **Swat**

Melee Triggered action 
| --- | ---:|
| **📏 Melee 1** | **🎯 The triggering creature or object** |

**Trigger:** A creature or object within distance deals damage to the predator.

**Effect:** The target is pushed up to 5 squares.

### t **Trample**

The predator can move through enemies' and objects' spaces at their usual speed. Any mundane size 2 or smaller object whose space they move through is destroyed. When the predator enters a creature's space for the first time on a turn, that creature takes 3 damage.

### t **Nature's Spirit**

While outdoors or in a natural environment, the predator can negate a bane on their abilities or turn a double bane into a bane.

# ARIXX

Pebbles dance as the ground quivers. A spray of rock and earth shatters the afternoon's peace, and an arixx blooms from the earth. Their mandibles drip sizzling acid as a talon impales their next meal sometimes a fat sheep, other times a shepherd.

An arixx is a chitinous burrowing insectoid beast who stands taller than a horse. Their hooked claws and serrated mandibles are fearsome weapons, but even more dangerous is the stream of caustic spittle they use to dissolve their prey.

# Pastoral Pest

Although arixxi can be found anywhere, they are a particular plague in settled lands. An arixx hunts alone, lurking a few feet below roadways and pastures. When their sensitive antennae detect movement above, they burst from the earth, dragging living prey into their tunnels to be devoured. These hit-and-run tactics make the arixx virtually impossible to eradicate-unless they have the bad luck to ambush a party of well-armed adventurers. Many communities pay a handsome bounty for a slain arixx.

# Terror of the Thaw

Arixxi are a year-round menace in the warmest lands. In temperate places, arixxi hibernate during the winter, granting farmers a season of peace. But this respite is paid for on the first thaw of spring, when every arixx awakens ravenous on the same day and bursts from the ground to feed.

### **Arixx Malice Malice Features**

At the start of an arixx's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

### s **Burning Maw 3 Malice**

The arixx dribbles acid over their mandibles, causing the next strike they make to gain an edge and deal an extra 3 acid damage.

### a **Geyser 5 Malice**

The arixx's underground tunnels swell with pressure, causing a sudden influx of hot gas to burst from a 3-square-by-3-square area anywhere on the surface. Each enemy in the area makes an Agility test.

- 1 4 damage; vertical push 5
- 2 4 damage; vertical push 3
- 3 The target shifts to the nearest unoccupied space outside the area.

### d **Solo Action 5 Malice**

The arixx takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

### p **Earth Sink 7 Malice**

The encounter map suddenly quakes, then begins to sink. Each creature on the ground who has a<1] is knocked prone. Until the end of the encounter, each creature who starts their turn on the ground and can't burrow must spend 1 additional square of movement to leave their starting position, or 2 squares if they start their turn prone or underground. A creature who starts and ends their turn in the same space on the ground and can't burrow sinks 1 square into the ground.

### d **Solo Monster**

End **Effect:** At the end of each of their turns, the arixx can take 5 damage to end one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw. This damage can't be reduced in any way.

Solo Turns: The arixx can take two turns each round. They can't take turns consecutively.

#### t **Earthwalk**

Difficult terrain composed of earth or loose rock doesn't cost the arixx extra movement.

#### t **Soft Underbelly**

A prone creature making a melee strike against the arixx has a double edge on the strike instead of taking a bane.

# ASHEN HOARDER

Grave robbing is a dangerous business, but necromancers need bodies for their experiments. To procure supplies and stay out of danger, these mages build ashen hoarders-hulking constructs made of magically reinforced humanoid bones.

# Appendages and Spikes

Ashen hoarders sport four long legs made from compact columns of bone, allowing them to move quickly and avoid creatures who might try to hinder the construct's grim work. Powerful clawed arms aid the hoarder in digging up corpses and fighting enemies.

When an ashen hoarder obtains corpses, they impale them on the many sharp bones protruding from their back. These spikes secure the corpses and charge them with corruptive energy, ensuring the cargo is ready for experimentation when it arrives at the necromancer's door.

# Weaponized Bodies

These automatons are equipped to protect their cargo. If enemies corner an ashen hoarder, the construct can use the energy stored within their corpses to reanimate them as deadly mines, detonating the remains with explosive corruptive energy. Once the threat is dead, the ashen hoarder can retrieve the enemies' remains and recollect the pieces of their original load.

# Soul Shackle

Creating and powering an ashen hoarder requires a vast amount of necromantic energy. Along with an entire ossuary worth of bones to construct its body, powering the construct requires a soul. That soul is divided between the hoarder and an object known as a Soul Shackle usually a ring or an amulet-that is used to command the construct. Destroying the Soul Shackle can free the trapped soul, but doing so sends an ashen hoarder into an indiscriminate unshackled rage as they feel part of their stolen soul shredded into oblivion. The construct lashes out against any living creature they can before collapsing in on themself. Freeing the soul still trapped inside the ashen hoarder's remains requires completing the Find a Cure downtime project in *[Draw Steel: Heroes](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Heroes)* and the assistance of a powerful holy figure.

### **Ashen Hoarder Malice Malice Features**

At the start of an ashen hoarder's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

### s **Relentless Strikes 3 Malice**

The ashen hoarder moves up to their speed and can make a free strike against two targets.

### a **Blade Wall 5 Malice**

The ashen hoarder summons a 10 wall of bones and blades into unoccupied squares within 5 squares of them. Each square of the wall has 5 Stamina. An enemy who comes adjacent to the wall for the first time in a round or starts their turn there takes 3 damage.

d **Solo Action 5 Malice** The ashen hoarder takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

a **Bone Storm 7 Malice** The ashen hoarder launches bone lances into the air, raining them down on enemies and impaling those unlucky enough to be on the receiving end. Each enemy within 20 squares of the ashen hoarder makes an Agility test.

- 1 14 damage; restrained and bleeding (save ends)
- 2 11 damage; bleeding (EoT)
- 3 6 damage

**Effect:** The ashen hoarder moves up to twice their speed in a straight line. Each creature or object in the path of this movement is either pushed into the nearest unoccupied space outside the path, or if they have m<3] is pushed forward until the movement ends. Any creature who is force moved forward into an obstacle is dazed (save ends).

# BASILISKS

With eight legs, a scaled rough hide, and razor-sharp teeth coated in poison, the basilisk is a deadly threat-even aside from their petrifying eye beams. This dreadful creature can fell the mightiest of foes with a look, turning them into an immobilized stone statue who remains thankfully unaware when the basilisk later consumes their petrified form at their leisure.

# Raising Young

Basilisks typically live in mated pairs and raise small clutches of younglings from the comforts of damp caves. Adults prefer to subsist on berries, fish, fowl, and carrion, resorting to eating their petrified victims only when starving. By contrast, basilisk younglings can eat only petrified victims, and basilisks have been known to travel far from their nest to populated areas in search of prey for their babies.

### Dangerous Servitors

Crime lords and overminds seek basilisk eggs to hatch, raising and training basilisks as bodyguards and pets. Training is dangerous, and many handlers (and their unscrupulous colleagues) find themselves turned to stone when a basilisk escapes and runs amok.

Some creatures keep basilisks not for their terrifying abilities, but for their immunity to petrification. Medusas commonly keep basilisks as pets, owing to their own limited options for companionship. Both parties benefit from this relationship, as the medusa feeds their own victims to the basilisk and their younglings.

# Alchemical Properties

Alchemists have discovered a gland in the basilisk's mouth that excretes an oil that reverts stone to flesh, making it easier to digest prey. If enough of the oil is collected, a salve can be created to restore a petrified victim. Unsavory alchemists pay good money to those willing to steal a basilisk youngling from their nest.

### **Restorative Salve**

After a basilisk dies, a character can make a Reason test to claim oil from the basilisk's mouth, which can be used to create a special salve. One dose of salve can be applied to a petrified creature as a main action, and 1 minute after the salve is applied, that creature is no longer petrified.

- 1 The character must complete the Find a Cure downtime project in *Draw Steel: Heroes* to create one dose of salve.
- 2 The character creates one dose of salve and can create two more doses by completing the Find a Cure downtime project.
- 3 The character creates three doses of salve.

### **Basilisk Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any basilisk's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

t **Stone Swim 3+ Malice** A basilisk acting this turn can burrow until the start of their next turn, and moves up to their speed. They have damage immunity 2 while underground. The basilisk can burrow through stone, but can't drag other creatures underground when they do so. At the start of each of the basilisk's turns, the Director can spend 1 Malice to let the basilisk continue burrowing.

### a **Walleye 7 Malice**

A basilisk spews reflective spittle across an adjacent vertical surface in a 3-square-by-3-square area. The basilisk can use their Petrifying Eye Beams ability to target a square in the area, causing the area and distance of that ability to become a 20 x 3 line within 1 square of the wall.

# BREDBEDDLE

In their true forms, bredbeddles are ogre-sized headless giants. Forever searching for their missing heads, they are drawn to populous lands, where they decapitate passers-by and magically adopt their victims' forms.

Although bredbeddles have no traditional sensory organs of their own, they are keenly aware of their surroundings. Some lurk along dark country lanes in their monstrous true forms. Others walk disguised among crowds, dropping their facade only long enough to waylay a stranger and lop off their head.

# Immortal Wanderers

Bredbeddles don't age, and if they are slain, their bodies reform a few days later. Long ago, bredbeddles were giants who stood high among the nobility of giant kind. But when they declared themselves rulers of all giant kind, their kin thwarted the coup and beheaded the bredbeddles. Now these fallen nobles search the world for their missing heads, each wielding the axe that decapitated them. Tales tell of how their heads are kept for safekeeping in a fire giant's cellar to be returned after an indeterminate period of good behavior, which no bredbeddle has exhibited thus far.

# Green with Frenzy

The longer a bredbeddle goes without a head, the more twisted and desperate their power grows. Their desire to be whole stretches out of their body in the form of shadowy dark-green ribbons, wrapping around and clinging to every surface they spill onto.

Travelers warn one another of roads rumored to be haunted by "wild green knights," often avoiding these routes for months. No journey is worth losing your head over.

# Bredbeddle Languages

When a bredbeddle communicates, they typically use High Kuric or the languages that their head's previous owner knew. A bredbeddle who has taken multiple heads over their lifetime most likely knows Caelian as well.

### **Bredbeddle Malice Malice Features**

At the start of a bredbeddle's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

t **Engreen 3 Malice** The bredbeddle's axe lengthens and turns a ghastly green, granting a +1 bonus to the distance of the bredbeddle's melee strikes and the dimensions of their burst area abilities until the end of their turn.

### a **Shadow Stockade 5 Malice**

A ghostly size 1L stockade seeps out from under the bredbeddle's feet to fill an unoccupied square within 10 squares. When a size 1L or smaller enemy enters the stockade's square, they are restrained (save ends). When a restrained creature is no longer restrained, the stockade fades away. At the start of each of the bredbeddle's turns, they can slide an active stockade and any creature in it up to 5 squares.

### d **Solo Action 5 Malice**

The bredbeddle takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

p **Green Phantom 7 Malice** A phantom second bredbeddle phases into view, appearing in an unoccupied space anywhere on the encounter map, then vanishing at the end of the round. The phantom bredbeddle shares the original bredbeddle's statistics but has 24 Stamina, corruption immunity 10, and can fly. The phantom bredbeddle can take one turn and use any of the bredbeddle's abilities except for villain actions. Only one phantom bredbeddle can be active at a time.

### d **Solo Monster**

End **Effect:** At the end of each of their turns, the bredbeddle can take 5 damage to end one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw. This damage can't be reduced in any way.

Solo Turns: The bredbeddle can take two turns each round. They can't take turns consecutively.

#### t **Heady or Not**

While headless, the bredbeddle can move into a space containing a severed head and attach it to their neck as a main action. Doing so physically transforms the bredbeddle, who takes on the appearance, size, weight, and stability of the head's original owner. If the bredbeddle takes the form of a creature of size 1L or smaller, the distance of their melee and burst area abilities decreases by 1. These effects last until the bredbeddle is killed or beheaded, or until the head falls off after 24 hours. A head that falls off this way can no longer be attached to this bredbeddle.

A creature must succeed on a **hard Might test** made as a maneuver to rip a head off the bredbeddle. If they fail, the bredbeddle can make a free strike against them.

#### t **Resilient Form**

The bredbeddle can't be physically transformed in any way except by their Heady or Not trait.

**Effect:** The bredbeddle points at the target and issues them a challenge. If the target refuses, they turn green until the end of the encounter (see Turn Green). If the target accepts the challenge, the bredbeddle shifts adjacent to the target, who makes a Might test with no additional modifiers.

 The target is beheaded (see Lop).

- 2 The target makes the test again.

# BUGBEARS

Bugbears are the bu'gath in the Khelt language, or "the bearers of the great fear." Modern bugbears come from early goblins who first stepped into the wode centuries ago. Fey magic twisted their bodies, making them grow imposingly tall and hairy while removing all sound from their footsteps.

Many bugbears become legendary hunters and mercenaries. Many more become reclusive and hide their whole lives in the shadows. A rare few dive into their magic potential and become living nightmares who haunt the wode.

# Thrown Into the Fray

Bugbears seldom seek the settlements of others for trade or allyship, and are known to tenaciously defend their own homes or their neighbors' homes. This has given them a reputation of being covert, insurgent warriors, when in reality, bugbears simply fight to maintain their quiet solitude.

When bugbears are compelled to take action, they take to the high ground and use their powerful arms to throw anything they can down at the problem. This includes daggers, heavy iron balls, each other, and sometimes throwing the enemy at the enemy.

# Goblin Bond

Bugbears value their shared origin with goblins and hobgoblins despite the three lines branching apart so dramatically. They think of themselves as goblinoids first and humanoids second, with that relationship providing a sense of common ground when cloistered bugbears come out of isolation.

### **Bugbear Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any bugbear's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

t **Goblin Malice Features 3-7 Malice** The bugbear activates a Malice Feature available to goblins.

### s **Grab Iron Ball 3+ Malice**

For every 3 Malice spent, one non-minion bugbear acting this turn grabs an iron ball and can use a maneuver to throw it at a creature within 5 squares of them. The creature takes damage equal to 8 - the number of squares the iron ball was thrown, and if they have m<1], they are slowed (save ends).

- **Malice**

s **Grab Javelin 5+ Malice** For every 5 Malice spent, one non-minion bugbear acting this turn grabs a javelin and can use a maneuver to throw it at a creature within 5 squares of them. The creature takes damage equal to 12 - the number of squares the javelin was thrown, and if they have m<1], they are bleeding (save ends). While a creature is bleeding this way, any ally of the bugbear within 2 squares of them can use a free maneuver to pull the bleeding creature up to 2 squares.

### p **Show Them the Great Fear 10 Malice**

**o Malice**

A bugbear infuses the encounter map with bu'gathic magic. Until the end of the encounter, all bugbears and allies have their speed doubled and can automatically climb at full speed while moving. Additionally, if the target of any bugbear or ally's strike has i<1], the target is also frightened (save ends) and must move their speed in a straight line away from the creature who made the strike.

# Bu'gathic Magic

Most bugbears have some control over their inherent magic, enabling them to perform a trick or two. Dedicated bugbear channelers have learned to evoke powerful shadow and rot magic. These mages can reshape the appearance of the world around them and temporarily alter their foes as defensive tactics, providing ample warning to enemies that they are capable of far worse if those enemies push onward. Bu'gathic magic also enables bugbears to hide their settlements behind shadowy veils within canyons and impenetrable swamplands.

# Bugbear Languages

Most bugbears speak Caelian, Khelt, and Szetch.

# CHIMERA

Massive flexing claws. Lashing draconic tail. Nimble leathery wings. And not one, but three menacing heads: a snarling lion, a helix-horned ram, and a dragon with fire sparking in their throat. Many see the chimera as an aggressor-but few know this creature's origins as a divine guardian.

# The First Chimera

The first chimera was a gift. A deity gave a devout queen this young guardian-one with a dragon's cunning, a lion's bravery, and a ram's tenacity. The queen raised the chimera to be a strong protector not just for herself but also her people, who loved the chimera and their ruler. But neighboring lands feared the beast. As a conquering force swept into the land, slaughtering the chimera was their fell goal.

The queen's resulting fury was said to be felt by the gods. As she screamed, a nearby volcano erupted, spewing basalt and chimeras over the land. With fiery might, the chimeras destroyed the opposing army, then dispersed. Each found a new territory and claimed the role of divine protector over that place, its inhabitants, and its treasures.

# Tactical Warriors

Chimeras have many ways to keep themselves and their charges from being cornered. The lion head snaps up enemies in massive jaws and hurls them away, the ram head pummels them to the ground, and the dragon head bathes them in fire. The three heads crying out together can shake even the most stalwart warriors.

# One Being, Three Heads

Unlike some other multiheaded creatures, a chimera possesses a single unified mind. Their heads work together, never snapping at one another over food, favors, or personality conflicts. The heads often express the chimera's emotions in unison, braying together in times of battle or purring all at once to show affection.

### **Chimera Malice Malice Features**

At the start of a chimera's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

### t **Defensive Snapping 3 Malice**

The chimera takes up a defensive stance. Until the start of their next turn, the chimera can make a free strike against each enemy who comes within 2 squares of them.

d **Solo Action 5 Malice** The chimera takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

### a **Unstable Terrain 5 Malice**

**5 Malice**

The chimera shakes the ground, causing an eruption of loose rocks and debris that creates three size 2 stone objects anywhere on the encounter map. Each creature adjacent to one or more objects when they appear who has a<2] takes 5 damage.

### p **Ashen Clouds 7 Malice**

 **Malice**

Until the start of the chimera's next turn, all areas of the encounter map are shrouded in a thick cloud of ash. All creatures and objects on the map have concealment that the chimera ignores. Additionally, each enemy in the cloud who has i<1] has line of effect only within 3 squares. The potency of this feature increases by 1 each time it's used.

# DEMONS

Creatures of incarnate hate, demons spawn naturally in the Abyssal Wasteland. They crave violence and suffering the way other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear lesser demons apart for fun.

The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another has a humanoid arm growing from their forehead.

### **Demon Stat Block List**

# Mortal Alliances

Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.

## Soul Reavers

Demons feast not on food or liquids, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while a demon is starved for souls, they can scarcely think. Whenever a demon kills a creature who has a soul, they consume that soul and keep its energy within their body. A demon can then burn that soul energy to enact their most devastating abilities.

## Lethe

When a demon's soul energy begins to flag, they fall into a state known as lethe-a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance. Demons who have fallen into lethe become single-minded and violent, seeking only to consume.

# Demonic Hierarchy

Mortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, each increasingly more powerful. Though demons don't use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service.

Each time a demon consumes a soul, there's a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. The evolution from one category to the next can be instantaneous, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt-or heroic.

### Demon Languages

Lower categories of demons speak Proto-Ctholl. As demons evolve and reach category 3 or higher, their speech turns into proper Tholl.

# Demons-1st Echelon

A number of lesser demons have been identified across categories 1 to 3.

**Pitlings** resemble rodents or insects with gleaming green eyes and terrible body odor, and disgorge a viscous, toxic phlegm.

**Ensnarers** are the result of pitlings getting hold of an unfortunate soul. A pitling in the process of digesting the soul of a creature has that soul physically bore through their head to become a fanged appendage. Mouths form across the creature's body, each attacking with long, barbed tongues.

**Frenzieds** are similar to ensnarers, but their transformation into a true demon is more advanced. This results in a fast and vicious creature full of energy and hungry for more souls.

**Bendraks** (BEN-drax) appear as an amalgamation of flesh and the shards of broken mirrors, which they use to distract and confuse their foes. A bendrak can divert an enemy's attack to another enemy, and can hide themselves or allies behind dazzling reflections.

**Mucerons** (MIU-sur-onz) are the result of an ensnarer going through repeated demon evolutions to become a brutish creature. They are covered in multiple mouths that shoot out barbed tongues, tearing at enemies as they are dragged out of position.

**Remasches** (REE-mash-iz) have physical forms blended with the nature of the wastes where they dwell. A remasch teleports around the battlefield, inflicting chaos on their enemies directly or through the minions they control. These demons are rumored to be the initial source of the teachings of all shadows through the College of Black Ash.

**Ruinants** (rew-in-ANSE) are possessed of glowing eyes and tendrilringed maws, their bodies covered in inflamed scars and their breath coming as a sickening wheeze. A ruinant can inflict fresh wounds and burns on their victims in a pattern mirroring those on the demon's own body.

**Torlases** (TORR-lahs-iz) are piecemeal abominations whose physical forms don't obey the mundane laws of geometry. They control the battlefield by using living flesh and whipping allies and enemies alike into advantageous position.

**Chorogaunts** (cor-roh-GAWNTS) are terrifying demon leaders. Each is an amalgamation of several demon bodies formed into a mobile musical instrument. Several heads are arranged into a chorus embedded in the demon's chest, and their ribs are upturned into a fleshy pipe organ. Their attacks entrance and confuse enemies, making them more vulnerable to other demons.

### **Demon Malice Level 1+ Malice Features**

At the start of any demon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

t **Soulburn 3 Malice**

Each demon acting this turn has a double edge on abilities.

p **Abyssal Evolution 7 Malice**

A demon minion of your choice transforms into a non-minion horde demon of the same level.

### a **Abyssal Rift 7 Malice**

Two size 2 rifts to the Abyssal Wasteland appear at locations of your choice. Any demon can use an abyssal rift as a portal to another abyssal rift in the encounter, moving into any space in one rift and appearing immediately in any unoccupied space in the other rift. A non-demon who enters a rift for the first time in a round or starts their turn there takes corruption damage equal to the level of the highest-level demon on the encounter map. An abyssal rift is an immovable object that has 25 Stamina, damage immunity 2, and holy weakness 5. The rift closes when there are no demons remaining on the encounter map. Additionally, a creature who has the Magic or Psionics skill can make a Reason test or Intuition test as a maneuver while adjacent to a rift to destabilize and close it.

- 1 The rift remains open and regains 5 Stamina.
- 2 The rift remains open.
- 3 The rift closes.

# Demons

# Demons-2nd Echelon

As demons consume more souls and their mercurial forms shift into more powerful ones, they begin to evolve more distinct personalities, desires, and intelligence-often based on the souls consumed. Across categories 4 to 6, demons develop a particular taste for certain types of souls, which eventually come to define them should they survive long enough.

**Grulqins** (GRUHL-kinz) consist of a bulbous head, two powerful arms, and a circular serrated blade of bone that runs down the middle of their head.

**Orliq** (or-LEEK) are made of shifting bone plates surrounding a swirling core of corruptive energy.

**Wobalas** (WOH-buh-luss) prefer to kill from afar while protected by allies, firing psychic bolts from bows shaped of their own flesh and sinew.

**Bale eyes**, sometimes called "flesh moons," are colossal floating orbs of roiling, dripping flesh. A weeping seam in that flesh opens to reveal a demonic eye whose gaze turns creatures' mental and physical faculties upside down.

**Fanglings** have bodies overgrown with teeth, fangs, and tusks from countless creatures. They are deadly in close quarters, to attackers and bystanders alike.

**Fiktin** (FIK-ten) are cunning hunters who disguise themselves as mundane objects, leaving a foul-smelling oily red residue wherever they have been. Their true form is a humanoid shape made of red oil.

**Gunge** (GUHNJ) demons are horrifically distended, with maws that can swallow a horse whole. A gunge vomits up bilious slime that traps and dissolves any creature unlucky enough to get caught in it.

**Tourmenauks** (tor-min-AUX) resemble a hulking ape with a dozen or more extra mouths distributed around their body. Though their brute force is formidable, this demon also inflicts raw psychic pain by wailing from their mouths in different voices-often the agonized voices of souls the tormenauk has devoured.

**Lumbering egresses** are mobile masses of warped flesh set around an enormous whirling portal to the demonic realms. Lesser demons pour out through these portals at alarming rates, letting these creatures act as devastating siege engines.

### **Demon Malice Level 4+ Malice Features**

 or lower.

At the start of any level 4 or higher demon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

t **Prior Malice Features 3-7 Malice** The demon activates a Malice feature available to demons of level

s **Abyssal Jaunt 3 Malice** One demon acting this turn folds space around them, temporarily

slipping in and out of the Abyssal Wasteland. Until the start of the demon's next turn, they ignore difficult terrain, can move through solid matter, and don't provoke opportunity attacks by moving. If the demon ends their turn inside solid matter, they are shunted out into the space from which they entered it.

# Demons

# Demons-3rd Echelon

Demons of categories 7 to 9 continue to mutate in new and unpredictable ways, or are sometimes corrupted and spawned from other powerful creatures to become part of the demonic hierarchy. Additionally, in a plane of chaos, the soulraker demon is notable for fashioning a facsimile of order within themself. These demonic wasps make up a single, chaotic hive mind. They serve a demonic hivequeen, who relies on cannibalizing her children to ingest any souls they've consumed.

**Soulraker scouts** are the vile progeny of a soulraker hivequeen demonic wasps who emerge from her distended abdomen with an earsplitting buzz.

**Soulraker soldiers** are demonic wasps armored in dense chitin who favor driving foes before them.

**Soulraker stingers** are wasps covered in poisonous barbed stingers that they launch like quills, their wings atrophied and unusable.

**Blight phages** were once angelic creatures. Corrupted by demonic forces, each is now a cruel, distended mockery of a cherubic form, covered in pestilent boils that seep ruinous blight.

**Chimerons** (kai-MEHR-ons) are a horrifying amalgam of multiple demonic forms melded into a unique monstrosity, driven by an unslakable hunger for souls.

**Styrichs** (STEE-rix) feature lanky bodies covered with manes of long, razor-sharp hair, which they whip around the battlefield to shred their enemies.

**Soulraker handmaidens** are abyssal parasites implanted in victims by a soulraker hivequeen. Handmaidens gestate inside a host until they're ready to emerge from the body, then consume souls until they're strong enough to transform into a new hivequeen.

**Soulraker praetorians** are the elite guards of a hivequeen, dripping foul-smelling ichor and using their barbed stingers to lay waste to foes.

A **soulraker hivequeen** is a demonic wasp whose abdomen houses their own soulraker wasp hive, and whose stinging ovipositor implants victims with handmaiden parasites.

### **Demon Malice Level 7+ Malice Features**

At the start of any level 7 or higher demon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

### t **Prior Malice Features 3-7 Malice**

The demon activates a Malice feature available to demons of level 6 or lower.

### b **Seeping Blight 5 Malice**

**5 Malice**

One demon acting this turn expels blight-digested soul juice onto the ground around them in a 3 burst that lingers until the start of their next turn. Any enemy who enters the area or starts their turn there takes 6 corruption damage, and has a double bane on power rolls until the start of their next turn.

### t **Implanted Parasite**

A host creature implanted by a soulraker hivequeen's **Stinging Ovipositor** has no physical or mental signs of the handmaiden gestating inside the host's body.

After 1d3 + 1 weeks of gestation, the handmaiden fully forms inside the host. The handmaiden always moves with and occupies the same space as the host and can't be separated from them. While totally within the creature, the handmaiden doesn't have line of effect to the host or targets outside the host and vice versa.

As a maneuver, the handmaiden can emerge from the host as a horrifying tower of flesh and bone that remains attached to the host's insides. While emerged, the handmaiden can use a move action to make the host move up to their speed and has access to the host's signature abilities, using the host's modifiers for any power rolls. The handmaiden has the same Stability as the host. If the handmaiden or host is force moved, the other moves with them. While emerged, the handmaiden can be targeted independently of the host. The handmaiden can retreat totally within the host's body as a maneuver. If the handmaiden dies, their remains separate from the host.

The Find a Cure downtime project in *Draw Steel: Heroes* can be used to find a cure that removes a handmaiden from a host. The cure kills the handmaiden when consumed.

# Demons-4th Echelon

The more souls a demon consumes, the more they evolve. The more they evolve, the more refined their tastes become, until eventually demons of category 10 can be satisfied only by consuming souls that exemplify particular qualities. Many demons of this category have their tastes honored by their titles, such as Gorgino, the Sensuous Feast; Tyx, the Obliviated Spiral; and Lorikta, the Discarded Dream.

**Optacus** (OHP-tih-cus) demons are abyssal eyes atop a spindly flesh stalk supported by innumerable legs. Able to affix to any surface, they shoot deadly beams of fire at distant foes.

**Tyburakis** (tee-berr-AH-kees) appear as a horrifying cross between a thresher shark and a terror lizard, their tails lined with tiny shark maws that allow them to bite multiple foes at once.

**Unguloids** (UHN-jyl-oids) have a centaur-like form, with a body and head resembling a demonic rhinoceros. They are known for their devastating charge.

**Izyaks** (ee-zi-YAHKS) have a mercurial form that ripples with psionic energy, making these demons appear different to all those who observe them. Their true form is a brain supported on four bone legs.

**Vicisitators** (vih-SIS-ih-tay-tors) are dangerous and horrifically unstable, the flesh and bone of their bodies trapped in a state of perpetual agonizing flux. Their very touch results in excruciating pain as it warps flesh, bone, and soul.

**Aurumvas** (or-UM-vahs) the demon king stands alone among named demons for craving not only wealth, but highly avaricious souls. A towering figure with a stack of crowns atop his ophidian head, he is a vision of opulence, excess, and absolute debasement. He lords over other powerful demons by virtue of the wealth held in his vast vaults in the Abyssal Wasteland, acquired through the slaughter of countless creatures. But even as he gazes upon his riches and supernatural treasures, Aurumvas wants for more. He draws lesser demons and wicked mortals to his service with the promise of minor treasures, knowing full well that one needs to spend wealth to make it. If left unchecked, Aurumvas's servile armies and glittering hoards might one day encompass the entire timescape.

### **Demon Malice Level 10+ Malice Features**

At the start of any level 10 or higher demon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

t **Prior Malice Features 3-7 Malice**

The demon activates a Malice feature available to demons of level 9 or lower.

### b **Soul Flense 7 Malice**

One demon acting this turn unleashes their pent-up agony and pain on every non-demon in a 5 burst. Each target makes a Presence test.

- 1 10 corruption damage; the target is soul flensed
- 2 The target is soul flensed
- 3 No effect.

**Effect:** The demon removes all conditions and effects on themself that can be ended by a saving throw, and transfers all those effects to each creature soul flensed this way.

# DEVILS

In the lower plane of Hell, devils of the Seven Cities vie unceasingly for power and control-a conflict fought foremostly through cunning and schemes. Devils are distinguished from other humanoids by skin in shades of azure and crimson, as well as their hellmarks: horns, tails, hooves, wings, and other infernal features.

# Precarious Pyramids

The Seven Cities of Hell stand atop strict hierarchy and bureaucracy. Primordial chains of command place each devil in service to a more powerful devil, with the seven archdevil rulers of Hell at the top. While devils are lawful, they're always looking for another way up the ladder. They twist every rule to their benefit to gain power and usurp those they answer to, eager to uncover loopholes in the eternal struggle for significance and supremacy.

# Silver Tongues

Winsome devils can acquire significant influence by bargaining for the souls of mortals on behalf of the archdevil they ultimately serve. Virtuosos with words, devils are skilled at striking deals and forging contracts. They exploit the weaknesses of mortals, whether greed, revenge, vanity, or simple desperation. In the heat of battle, a devil's supernatural charisma can influence a mortal to do their bidding, often without realizing until it's too late.

### **Negotiations with Devils** until the end of the encounter.

Devils are eager to negotiate and strike deals, but often require more compelling arguments and concrete evidence from the other party. You can pick from the following motivations and pitfalls to quickly create a devil from one of the Seven Cities for a negotiation (see Chapter 11 in *Draw Steel: Heroes*):

- ¥**Motivation:** Greed, Power, Legacy
- ¥**Pitfall:** Benevolence, Freedom, Protection

During a negotiation, an NPC devil has their impression and patience increased by 1 (to a maximum of 5). Their interest goes up to 10 instead of 5.

When an NPC devil is ready to make an offer, divide their interest by 2 to get their final response. A devil typically never settles a negotiation unless they're promised something desirable in return.

## True Names

All devils have two names: one by which they're commonly known, and another secret true name. Each devil zealously safeguards the latter, as their true name can be spoken aloud to aid in summoning them-or in stripping them of their power.

# Hell's Defectors

Not every devil in the Seven Cities wants to ruthlessly ascend the hierarchy. Some desire advancement, but they remain dissatisfied at the bottom. As luck would have it, these fiends can free themselves from Hell's bureaucracy, for when a mortal overestimates their fortitude and dies while enacting an infernal summoning, it can leave an enterprising devil stranded in the mundane world.

# Devil Languages

Most devils speak Anjal and Caelian, among other languages. The more powerful a devil, the more languages they learn in order to more easily make ironclad contracts with a wide variety of people and cultures. Outside of rare circumstances, devils are always willing to negotiate, ever desiring to twist a situation in their favor.

### **Devil Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any devil's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

### s **Bureaucratic Tape 3 Malice**

**3 Malice**

One devil acting this turn uses a signature ability against an adjacent creature. On a tier 3 outcome, the target of the ability has a double bane on strikes (save ends).

### t **Underhanded Tactics 5+ Malice**

One or two devils can teleport to a space adjacent to one or more creatures who aren't hidden and make a free strike. For each 2 additional Malice spent on this feature, one additional devil can teleport.

p **Read the Small Print 7 Malice** Each enemy in the encounter is subject to a bad deal proposed by the devils. An enemy must choose between having damage weakness 5 or taking a bane on power rolls. The bad deal lasts

### **Devil Temptations**

Although some devils enjoy comfort and opulence for their own sake, they primarily use treasure as bargaining chips in fiendish compacts: bait on the devils' infernal barbs.

Even more sinister than a prize won in a devil's hard bargain is a gift freely given by a devil. The advantages of such a gift are conditional, lasting only until the devil revokes it at some inconvenient time.

The following are samples of the wonders that a devil can offer-to only the most discriminating customers, of course. A devil might only have two or three of these items available for trade, but others (such as an archdevil's wing) can be won by force. See *Draw Steel: Heroes* for more information about how these items can be used by heroes.

**Components:** An archdevil's wing, archdevil's blood, soul chalk, a wide selection of true names

**Project Sources:** Notes in Anjali for the Devil's Bargain armor enhancement or a Hellcharger Helm, notes in Hyrallic for a Mediator's Charm

**Titles:** Diabolist, Maestro

**Treasures:** G'Allios Visiting Card, Thief of Joy

**Wealth:** Each hero can earn 1 wealth in exchange for a small favor

# DRACONIANS

Draconians-wyrmwights as some call them, also known as dragon knights in Orden-are a people created through an obscure ritual known as Dracogenesis. Most draconians have an elemental affinity connected to their draconic scales, which they can change given enough time and training.

Six individual draconians are presented in this section-not an adventuring party, but six warriors whose reputations precede them. All are likely to be found serving in various military forces as high-ranking commanders.

### Aeolyxria the Uncanny

From the moment she hatched, Aeolyxria (ay-oh-LIX-ree-ah) has enjoyed a fascination with the occult. She wanders the land, gathering strange tomes and artifacts to study. When she takes a job, it's because she has a new doohickey she wants to test out. Aeolyxria possesses a sharp, tactical mind that lets her treat any battlefield as if it offered homefield advantage. If she could just get a handle on all her equipment, she'd be unstoppable!

### Locratix the Morningstar

A traveler from a faraway land and the sole progeny of her Dracogenesis clutch, Locratix (low-CRA-tics) focuses on survival over all other things. The very concept of the dragon knights is anathema to her, as there is no reason a wyrmwight should hand over the power that keeps them alive. Locratix travels widely while taking on mercenary jobs, but she is always just one better deal away from skewering her present employer on the end of her lance.

### Lydixavus the Deadeye

Nothing escapes Lydixavus (lee-DIX-uh-vas) or their unrivaled precision. After decades of careful training, they have honed their breath weapon into a swift and far-traveling bullet of ice. Lydixavus is motivated by revenge. Each scar, each dent in their scales tells a story, and Lydixavus aims to return those gifts tenfold to those who bestowed them.

### Myxovidan the Sintaker

Myxovidan (mix-OH-vih-din) was raised by a secluded order of monks who claimed his obsidian-black scales and nausea-inducing breath were an evil that must be purged. They subjected him to an austere lifestyle, full of intense training, meditation, and denial of worldly pleasures. But Myxovidan's hunger would be satisfied, one way or another. When Myxovidan departed the order, he left behind a collection of emaciated monk corpses who looked as though they'd had the life sucked out of them.

### Phrrygalax the Subduer

Phrrygalax (fuh-RIJ-ih-lax) was once a dragon knight in the service of Good King Omund. Though he took the oath to defend others against tyranny, he was always keenly aware he was created for violence. When the betrayal of the dragon knight Mandrake fractured the Dragon Phalanx that was the order of the dragon knights, Phrrygalax gleefully renounced his oath to follow what he believes to be his true, brutal purpose. Many who served with him believed he was merely waiting for a convenient excuse to do so.

### Dorzinuuth the Base

To those who know the Dragon Phalanx of old, no name inspires more awe and fear than that of Dorzinuuth (dor-ZIN-yew-uth). A mastermind on the battlefield and the foundation of the dragon knights' fraternity, Dorzinuuth was known for mounting daring campaigns and always returning with the same number of soldiers and often alongside new recruits. In the wake of the death of Good King Omund, many were shocked to see Dorzinuuth debase himself with banditry and petty mercenary jobs. Others hold on to the hope that he makes unknown moves in darkness, waiting for the day when he can again uphold his oath in the light.

### Draconian Languages

Most draconians speak Caelian in addition to the languages of their employers and creators. Lydixavus, Phrrygalax, and Dorzinuuth all speak Caelian and Vastariax. Aeolyxria speaks Caelian and the First Language. Locratix speaks Caelian and Oaxuatl. Myxovidan speaks Caelian and Axiomatic.

### **Draconian Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any draconian's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

s **Guarding Gale 3 Malice** A draconian acting this turn flaps their wings and creates a mighty gale. Each creature adjacent to the draconian is pushed up to 4 squares, and if they have m<2], , they are knocked prone.

# DRAGONS

"John, you don't have to do this."

Sir John ignored his draconian friend.

"Maybe ditch the arms and armor," Bootblack said.

"Nah, I thought of that." John looked down at his gear. "This is who I am. I go in there under some... some *pretense* and I might foul the whole thing up." He shook his head. "Just another kind of trick."

He turned to Embers. "Any luck?" he asked.

Ember's eyes, currently solid starscape, faded into her normal, goldflecked azure eyes. "Yes," she said, and some tension fled from the group. "Choryvixiar, the Forge of Pain."

"Oh, wonderful," Jackson Bootblack said while the rest of the team groaned.

Embers recalled her void vision. "I know this dragon," she said and closed her eyes. "Wings like sword blades. Choryvixiar razed a dwarven city, the city of Kal Aethyrion."

Dazar gave John a look. "John, Kal Aethyrion was sacked twelve thousand years ago," he said.

"It wanted the legendary armory of Zor, the Metalmaster of Aethyrion. They treated with it. It allowed them to evacuate the city first." Embers opened her eyes and looked at John. "It can be reasoned with," she said, and nodded.

"I think it'll work," John said.

Vaantikalisax put a hand on the pommel of his mace. "*Why?*" he demanded.

"I'll tell you why," Jackson said. Everyone looked at the polder. "Well, we all know it's in there, right?" Jackson asked, gesturing to the cave. They nodded.

"Then it... or he, I guess, knows we're out here. And he hasn't roasted us, so... maybe he's waiting to hear our offer?"

John smiled at the troubadour having come to the same conclusion he had. He turned to Embers. "A crucible dragon?" She nodded. He sighed.

"The crucibles make fortresses of iron. Steel. And they burn with eternal heat," Dazar said, the second most qualified loremaster among them. "This is just a cave," he said.

Gwillyv appeared with what looked like a metal roof shingle. She passed it to A Mist Curls Around Dying Embers. You could see how heavy it was by the way she held it.

"Yes," Embers said, looking at the metal dragonscale made of blackened iron. She pressed her palm against it. Metal scored over centuries and impregnated with ancient soot. "This creature had a home recently, such as you describe, theochron. But something happened and it was forced to flee. Wounded, probably. This would have been years ago, and it slumbered here since. Then something woke it."

She turned the heavy, metal scale over in her hands. "When a dragon gets this old, all it knows is pain. It becomes hateful, *spiteful*."

"Yeah, I had a bad toothache once, it was a bitch, I know how it feels," Bootblack said. Everyone ignored him.

"There has to be some other option," Sir Vaantikalisax said.

"Well, I talked to Ffyllynvir or however you pronounce it," John said. "The Thorns are at an impasse. They can't pull back without exposing whole villages to this thing, and they can't bring it down."

"So we fight!" Dazar said and gripped his staff in a battle stance. John shrugged. "They tried that," he said. "If the Thorns couldn't take this thing down I doubt we could. Time to try something else."

Dazar came to inspect the dragonscale. Vaantikalisax grabbed John by the arm. "John, do you know what you're doing?" he said under his breath. Others had asked essentially the same question, but this was Vaant.

John smiled at his friend. "Yeah." He looked at the group arguing about the wisdom of his plan and gestured with his head toward a boulder before walking away from the group. Vaant followed. When they were out of earshot, John explained his plan.

"Look. I don't believe in coincidences, okay? We need the Thorns, at the keep, when Saxton shows up. So what happens? They're tied up with this dragon. Well that's pretty nice for Saxton, isn't it?" He left it at that. Waited for Vaant to catch up.

Vaant looked around. It took him a second. Then he looked at John. "You think Saxton got here before us."

"Yes, I do," John said. "I told you I talked to Ffyllynvir, right? Do you know what they said?" John paused for a moment and his eyes unfocused as he remembered what Embers said the dragon's name was. "Choryvixiar," he said, suddenly coming back to reality, "started this vendetta against the wode elves a *week* after Saxton came to power. And *I* think? It might have been *less* than a week."

"Ah," Vaant said, impressed. "And you don't believe in coincidences."

"If Embers is right, this dragon might be the most dangerous thing, of any kind, in the entire duchy. If *I* were Saxton? Getting that thing on my side would be my first priority."

"Because if it works," Vaant said, "you start your campaign with a powerful ally. And if it doesn't..."

"Then he starts with a powerful enemy. So, first thing he does is find out whose side the dragon's on."

"Because that dictates his entire strategy." Vaant was impressed and more impressed because he'd known John for years and was still surprised. "Well done, John." Vaant acted like the dragon was already on their side.

"Everyone thinks this is some big risk, some daring ploy," John was looking at the rest of the team. He shook his head, then looked back at Vaant. "But if Saxton did it, if *he* talked to this thing? *I* can. And I'm a better negotiator."

"Because you're not an... an 'unrepentant...'" He couldn't remember what the polder, Jackson Bootblack, had called Lord Saxton earlier.

"Cockbag," John finished for him. "I'm not an unrepentant cockbag, yeah, that's the idea."

"Smart," Vaant said and shook John's hand. "Good luck."

"Hey!" Jackson Bootblack said. John turned to look at him. "Saxton's armor is made from the whispering iron," he said. "It's only found in Hell. Pretty good prize for a dragon with taste who turned out to be on the right side. Or *no* side."

John looked from the polder to the others. "Is that true or did you make it up?"

"I'll tell you after you come out." Bootblack smiled. "*If* you come out." John shook his head with amused exasperation. Bootblack spread his hands and bowed deeply.

Sir John proceeded toward the cave.

"John," Embers said. John sighed and stopped. "Flatter him," the void mage said. "Appeal to his vanity. Remind him that he's the most powerful thing in all Omund's Land."

"I got it," John said and filed the information away. He didn't really know what he was going to say. He was going to present himself and see what happened.

"And if you're wrong?" Gwylliv whispered. John could barely hear her, but he could guess what she said.

John shrugged with one shoulder. "If I'm wrong, we're all going to die anyway. No point living in fear. Anyone else?" No one said anything. Only Vaant and Embers could look him in the eye.

"Wish me luck," Sir John said, and walked alone into the dragon's lair.

# On Dragons

Terrifying behemoths. Harbingers of destruction and woe. Dragons claim the world for themselves, throw the innocent into despair, and inspire heroes to draw steel.

#### Where the Elements Meet Anguish

As elementals are pure expressions of the mundane world, their shapes can become hardened and bent by intense energies permeating that world. Over time, an elemental entangled in extreme concentrations of rancor or grief might crystallize into a terrifying creature known as a dragon.

Dragons are both a provocateur and a consequence of people's anguish. A thorn dragon will cover crops and forests in a fortress of bramble vines and threaten to starve the people living there, yet they were born out of decades of hunger and strife that came before them. Vanquishing a dragon might be necessary to save innocent lives, but unless the underlying problems are addressed, another dragon will take their place in time.

# **Draco Vulgaris**

Many regular dragons share a number of commonalities between them, such as powerful wings, whiplike tails, and reptilian faces adorned with horns. People categorize dragons more specifically based on where they're found and how those environments have shaped their forms, such as the gloom dragon having a telltale mantle of fog. Some individual dragons retain a trait or two from their primordial forms, while more powerful dragons have been known to intentionally change their shapes to distinguish themselves even further.

Across all dragons, their breath is their most violent form of self-expression. Whether they roar to ward off threats or charge their breath with elemental energy, no good comes from a dragon opening their mouth.

### **Wyrmscale**

Most dragons are covered in wyrmscale, a hardy plate that both absorbs and emits elemental energy. Wyrmscale not only protects dragons, but allows them to catalyze their bodies and further shape their environment. The crucible dragon, for example, erupts with blasts of steam that let them take to the air and rain down death upon their foes.

When a dragon feels threatened, their wyrmscale radiates massive amounts of energy and creates a barrier around them. This barrier buffers both incoming and outgoing force, allowing the dragon to become even more fearsome should their defenses break down.

### **Lords of Their Domains**

It is said that a dragon's physical form includes the land they're found in. The longer a dragon spends time in a location, the more control they have over it. In an omen dragon's domain, for instance, the land becomes barren as old souls become suspended in its thickened air, with new life unable to breach the soil.

This impact is more than a passive consequence of a dragon's presence, for dragons use their magic to set seals upon creatures and lands they claim as their own. To be "dragonsealed" in this way is to become an extension of the dragon's might and subject to their fury.

Folk in cultures that have developed in close proximity to a dragon might give alms to a dragon as if they were a saint, and treat the dragon's seal as a blessing. There is some value to this, for few other predators are foolish enough to encroach on a dragon's territory.

#### Dragon Hoards

Legendary heroes protect the common folk from dragons. Foolhardy adventurers brave a dragon's lair to take their treasure.

Mature dragons hoard vast amounts of treasure and wealth as a hunting technique. The more valuable their trove, the more prey they lure into their clutches. Desperate kings have sent whole armies to their deaths for the opportunity to expand a kingdom's wealth. Their efforts only expand a dragon's hoard, though, as weapons, armor, and magic trinkets add to the wealth that can't be ignored.

Younger dragons still settling their domains have been known to scour ruins and ancient cities for treasures to start their hoard. It is not unheard of for a dragon to either repeatedly visit or settle near people who willingly give them their valuables and heirlooms.

### **What's In A Hoard?**

It's said that the only creature greedier than a dragon is a dragon hunter. Dragons know this all too well, and their lairs are accordingly well-hidden and guarded. Even if would-be thieves stumble upon an absent dragon's hoard, their troubles are only beginning: some dragons magically know the locations of every treasure purloined from their hoard, while others maintain discreet contacts with local fences and dealers in rare goods.

The following are sample treasures from a dragon's hoard. The hoard contains the treasure from each echelon up to and including the dragon's echelon. These items can be found in *Draw Steel: Heroes*.

### **1st Echelon**

**Components:** Dragon scales, horns, or venom glands

**Titles:** Dragon Blooded

**Wealth:** Each hero earns 1 wealth

### **2nd Echelon**

**Treasures:** Kuran'zoi Prismscale, Purified Jelly

### **3rd Echelon**

**Project Sources:** Notes in Vastariax for the Dragon Soul armor enhancement, notes in Zaliac for a Thunderhead Bident

### **4th Echelon**

**Treasures:** Blade of Quintessence, Page from the Infinite Library: Solaris

#### Draco Nobilis

Regular dragons should not be confused with the elder dragons, otherwise known as true dragons. These legendary beings are said to be able to devour entire worlds. Even the most fearsome meteor dragon possesses only a modicum of a true dragon's power and wiles.

(The draco nobilis will be explored in future adventures and products.)

### Thorn Dragon

Thorn dragons take root in the destitution of nature, and are cultivated by the suffering of those who struggle against the cruelty of drought, fire, flood, and more. Though a region's people might have long overcome past famine, the desperation of those who suffered long before has already nurtured their future scourge.

These dragons appear born of the wood, resembling living thickets bedecked in torturous thorns. With twisting briar horns and wings shaped by tangled roots, thorn dragons embody the richness of nature they so readily leech the life from.

### **Conquerors of the Green**

Thorn dragons cultivate their lairs in lush farmlands or flourishing forests. They engulf these beautiful regions in massive briar thickets, choking out existing flora until their own brambles are the only things that grow. In forests, this process drives out local fauna smart enough to flee rather than foolishly fight against the wood's new ruler. When a thorn dragon establishes their lair over a village's farmlands, local folk either wisely relocate or slowly starve for the sake of stubborn pride.

### **Natural Curators**

More intelligent dragons seek all forms of riches for their hoard, but thorn dragons have no eye for worldly treasures. Instead, they amass the wealth of the wild they represent. Thorn dragons stockpile food even food they won't eat-alongside uncut gemstones, minerals and ore, wood, oils, and spices.

### **Bestial Instincts**

Compared to more powerful dragons, thorn dragons are closer to beasts in temperament. They are incapable of speech and act primarily on instinct as they expand their territories, defend their lairs, and grow their hoards.

Despite this, the folk of certain settlements manage to avoid being driven from their homes or starved at the expense of being dependent on a thorn dragon's bestial ego. These farmers and woods folk come to a tenuous understanding with the dragon, trading them the kinds of treasure they desire in exchange for meager foodstuffs from the dragon's hoard.

### **Territorial Brutes**

Thorn dragons are highly territorial, and are vigilant against potential threats to their lairs. To defend their homes, these dragons take advantage of their thickets by dragonsealing intruders, pushing and pulling them across the briars, and letting the thorns bleed them dry. When mere brambles aren't enough, thorn dragons either imbue those brambles' barbs with poison or breathe out those toxins directly, taking pleasure in slowly draining the life from their enemies.

### **Thorn Dragon's Domain**

If the encounter map is a location the dragon has occupied for 1 week or more, all surfaces on the map are covered in overgrowth. Any creature other than the dragon who starts their turn on the encounter map has their speed reduced by 2 (to a minimum of 1). Any creature made restrained while on the ground is also made bleeding.

### Gloom Dragon

Where twilight spills long and cold over the lands and chilling fog hangs heavy and wet through long autumns and winters, there you will find gloom dragons. Wreathed in churning shadows and wrapped in glittering dark scales, gloom dragons bring with them heavy fog and mist that manifests hallucinations, trapping their prey in nightmares.

### **Thrill of the Hunt**

While many dragons command grand enclosed spaces, gloom dragons make their lairs within sprawling, murky wilds, commanding vast territories. As clever as ravens and as cunning as hunting beasts, they use mimicry and hallucinations to draw unsuspecting travelers ever farther into the mists of their domain, until the fog swallows the sound of those travelers' screams.

In areas where gloom dragons settle, people are known to have more nightmares than usual.

### **Intangible Treasures**

Gloom dragons are eerie collectors of voices, memories, and nightmares, as well as material items. Though able to speak, they can only repeat exactly what they've already heard, and so they prize their vast collections of voices and phrases, using these sounds to lure mortals close enough to draw out their memories and fears. Endlessly curious and fascinated by terror, gloom dragons are keen to see what hallucinations terrorize their prey before they slaughter them.

When a gloom dragon slays a victim, they take not just their valuables, but also whatever is most meaningful to their fears. A broken mirror from a dead lover will always fascinate a gloom dragon more than a perfect ruby brooch.

# **Unnerving Neighbors**

Instinct and curiosity drive these enshrouded hunters. It is rare to find a gloom dragon who can be reasoned with, but some might develop an understanding with nearby settlements, such that each leaves the other to their business. Since gloom dragons focus on individual terrorizing over mass destruction, it is relatively easy to coexist with one lurking in the swamps nearby. But in such cases, these dragons become the subject of stories told to children, warning them to never follow voices into the fog.

### **Gloom Dragon Languages**

Eerie myths surround the gloom dragons, for they wield languages they do not themselves speak. These draconic nightmares can mimic any sound they've heard. But more mysteriously, the magic that produces their hallucinations also mimics the sounds a foe's mind produces, no matter their language. If a hero hallucinates a loved one dying, everyone around will hear that loved one's screams for help.

### **Gloom Dragon's Domain**

If the encounter map is a location the dragon has occupied for 1 week or more, illusory magic suffuses the location with shadowy malevolence. Each creature on the encounter map other than the dragon takes a −2 penalty to saving throws made to end the frightened condition. Additionally, whenever a frightened enemy on the encounter map takes damage, they take an extra 3 psychic damage.

Additionally, the enemy's Intuition score is treated as 1 lower for the purpose of resisting potencies until the end of the encounter.

# Crucible Dragon

Crucible dragons are born from metallic elementals touched by the toxic combination of fiery rage and ice-cold grief-often the result of failure in the pursuit of perfection. Each dragon is a dark forge of abandoned creativity melted down in fires of spite, jealousy, and hate.

These metallic dragons are massive, heavy creatures requiring an immense release of heat to engage in flight. Their scales range from gleaming silver to blackened iron, depending on how fastidious they are about cleaning, and are occasionally gilded with more-precious metals. Their long tails terminate with a massive, hammer-like tip that can freeze over and instantly cool hot metal.

### **Bastions of Steel**

Crucible dragons make their homes high in the mountains, most commonly in peaks cut through with thick veins of iron ore. Occasionally, one will take over a fortress or outpost, but wherever they settle, the first thing a crucible dragon sets in place is a colossal anvil. From there, the dragon consumes vast amounts of iron, slagging that iron in their belly to create a fortress of steel around them. Much of the slag is expelled into heated vats for forging, but a dragon keeps a small reserve inside their gut in case they need to melt any intrusive adventurers.

### **Discerning Collectors**

Crucible dragons are obsessive collectors, and have a habit of narrowly focusing on a singular creation when it comes to collection and replication. Bynirak, the Rain of Ten Thousand Spears, is known to collect only the most finely crafted and powerful magic polearms in Vasloria. Joris'nyrathi, the Scorching Aegis, is said to have a collection of shields that would rival any god of the forge.

All crucible dragons manage to accrue large amounts of armaments and armor in their hoards. They care little for gems and gold, other than for melting down as filigree or embossing the weapons and armor they forge.

### **Flawed Pursuits**

The failure that spawned a crucible dragon drives their obsessive pursuits. They endlessly attempt to reproduce the perfect treasures they count among their most prized possessions, but can only recreate flawed copies at a fraction of their original power. Discarded projects, melted heaps of raw iron, and scrap angrily embedded into cavern walls perpetually surround a crucible dragon as examples of their failures, perpetuating a cycle of obsessive rage, grief, and inescapable decline.

### **Crucible Dragon Languages**

The oldest of crucible dragons are known to speak some Vastariax, though younger dragons are typically silent. However, survivors of an encounter with a younger crucible dragon sometimes report the monster using the Caelian phrases "not enough" and "mine."

### **Crucible Dragon's Domain**

If the encounter map is a location the dragon has occupied for 1 week or more, melted metal and blades coat nearly every surface. Any creature other than the dragon who starts their turn in physical contact with a surface on the encounter map takes 5 damage. Such creatures take an additional 5 damage when they take damage from being force moved into a surface on the map. Whenever an enemy in the encounter uses an ability that deals lightning damage, they take 1d6 damage to themself and each enemy and object adjacent to them.

Solo Turns: The dragon can take two turns each round. They can't take turns consecutively.

#### b **Magnetized Wyrmscale Aura**

The dragon's scales create a 3 aura of magnetism around them that affects large masses of metal. Any creature who enters the area for the first time in a round or starts their turn there while wearing metal or while slagged (see **Slag Spew**) is pulled up to 2 squares toward the dragon. A creature pulled this way who has m<3] is unable to willingly move away from the dragon.

### **Crucible Dragon Malice Malice Features**

**Malice Features**

At the start of a crucible dragon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

### a **Swordfall 3 Malice**

While the dragon is flying, they shape themself into a blade and fall. Each creature and object in the dragon's space when they hit the ground and in a 6 x 4 line within 1 square of the dragon takes 7 damage. A creature who takes this damage and has a<4] takes 4 extra damage per square the dragon fell and is restrained (save ends). A creature not restrained this way can move into the nearest unoccupied space.

### a **Shower of Blades 5 Malice**

The dragon shakes loose a cloud of shattered weapons in a 6 x 4 line within 1 square of them. Each creature and object in the area makes an Agility test.

- 1 16 damage; bleeding (save ends)
- 2 13 damage; bleeding (EoT)
- 3 7 damage

d **Solo Action 5 Malice** The dragon takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

p **Meltdown 7 Malice** The dragon superheats the ground across the encounter map until the end of the round. Any enemy who starts their turn on the ground is slagged as if affected by the dragon's Slag Spew ability.

### Omen Dragon

They have been known by many names: Reaper, Blight, Sorrow, Stillness, Vengeance, Grief. The omen dragons carry as many meanings and interpretations as death itself-for they are death embodied. This dragon is a coalescing of wayward souls, the stench of death solidified, that clings to the last vestiges of this world-to the detriment of their surroundings.

### **Life and Death**

The opposite of life isn't death-it's stagnation. When a soul refuses to move on, it lives outside the cycle of life. Souls can have any number of reasons to linger: anger, fear, sadness, a thirst for revenge. One skilled at dealing with the undead might even be able to shepherd such a soul back into its cycle. But when hundreds of souls with hundreds of unique motivations bind themselves to an elemental and form an omen dragon, the only practical way to stop them is to destroy what they've become.

As the embodiment of these wayward souls, the omen dragon wields them like weapons. They can send restless souls to grab creatures and pull them in, or to possess their attackers, compelling them to distraction in the middle of a fight. They even wrap themselves in the most durable of souls, creating a stifling aura.

### **Life Outside Life**

Just as the omen dragon exists outside the cycle of life, so too does their domain. The omen dragon's dragonseal brings desolation and stagnancy to all living things. Growth does not happen. Living things that grow or creatures who dwell near an omen dragon's domain do not age. One can often find secret societies researching lichdom residing in

such sites, for what better place to study than a stagnant wasteland that grants one infinite time?

The effects that surround an omen dragon also mean that new life cannot begin. Civilization cannot exist, let alone prosper, without a reliable food source. When living creatures die in these dragons' domains, their bodies do not decompose. Their souls are sucked into the omen dragon, granting the creature ever more power.

# **Wicked Visions**

To face off against an omen dragon is to stare down death itself. One can spend only so long near a choir of restless souls before being compelled to sing. For the sin of defiance, this dragon bestows upon their attackers an omen of their own death. Tarry too long near the creature, and a hero risks fulfilling that prophecy, even if they can weather the dragon's unrelenting attacks.

### **Omen Dragon Languages**

An omen dragon speaks with the voices of all the souls they have collected. In addition to Vastariax, the dragon speaks and understands whatever languages those souls knew in life.

### **Omen Dragon's Domain**

If the encounter map is a location the dragon has occupied for 1 week or more, any creature on the map who regains Stamina regains only half the expected amount. Additionally, when a creature on the map who has a soul dies, the dragon absorbs the soul, granting the Director 1 Malice. The creature can't be brought back to life until the dragon is destroyed.

### d **Solo Monster**

End **Effect:** At the end of each of their turns, the dragon can take 15 damage to end one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw. This damage can't be reduced in any way.

Solo Turns: The dragon can take two turns each round. They can't take turns consecutively.

#### t **Deathcount**

Several of the dragon's abilities impose a Deathcount on a target. At the end of every turn, a creature with a Deathcount who is within the area of the dragon's Stagnant Wyrmscale Aura has that Deathcount reduced by 1. When a creature's Deathcount hits 0, they die. If multiple Deathcounts are imposed on a creature, they don't stack. Only the lowest Deathcount takes effect. All Deathcounts are lost when the dragon is reduced to 0 Stamina.

#### b **Stagnant Wyrmscale Aura**

The dragon's scales create a 4 aura of supernatural stagnancy around them. The area is difficult terrain for enemies, and no creature except the omen dragon can regain Stamina while in the area. Any creature dragonsealed by the omen dragon who starts their turn in the dragon's aura and doesn't have a Deathcount gains a Deathcount of 12.

**Malice**

### Meteor Dragon

They dwell in the cold, airless depths of space in lair-cities built of stolen kingdoms for centuries at a time. Then without warning or mercy, a meteor dragon attacks.

#### Kingdom Killers

A meteor dragon's territory is hard to define. Their attacks might come ages apart, and not every dead civilization or ruined city is the work of a dragon. But when a city grows too great, an empire too powerful, or a culture too advanced, the meteor dragon descends. Their violence isn't mindless or wanton, but cold and calculated. Often, they breach dams, trigger landslides, and devastate granaries and fields, knowing that the chaos and devastation they unleash will continue long after they return to their lairs.

# **Cities in the Sky**

Other dragons hoard trinkets and baubles. Meteor dragons claim their domain over infrastructure. Palaces, fortresses, monuments, and towers are often stolen by these creatures and brought back to their spacefaring lairs, arranged into dilapidated tableaus of the places they have obliterated. A meteor dragon's floating lair-city is both their hoard and home, fused together and secured by the dragon's glittering crystal dragonseal. Within this labyrinthine jumble of ruination, a meteor dragon lurks in wait for the next civilization to grow too comfortable.

# **Avatar of the Infinite**

Meteor dragons have an innate mastery over gravitational forces that allows them to crush enemies and buildings on a whim. They're among the smallest of the dragons, but the density of their bodies exudes an intense field of the cold, airless void of space around them wherever they go.

A meteor dragon's body is infused with crystalline starlight, which they can convert to a barrage of white-hot energy rays. At any distance, the dragon's presence can forever sear the minds of lesser creatures.

# **Voidlight Annihilation**

Voidlight is the name given to the unique energy produced by the breath of a meteor dragon. It is anathema to existence, an evil energy that destroys all. Anything that exists, no matter its material, strength, or potency, is inverted and ceases to exist when bathed in voidlight.

### **Meteor Dragon Languages**

Meteor dragons are not known for their conversational habits. When they do deign to speak, it is exclusively in Vastariax and the First Language.

### **Meteor Dragon's Domain**

If the encounter map is a location the dragon has occupied for 1 week or more, each creature other than the dragon has their stability reduced to 0 and automatically obtains a tier 1 outcome on Agility tests. Additionally, any creature who is suffocating during the encounter takes an extra 1d6 damage at the end of each round.

#### b **Voidshroud Wyrmscale Aura**

# DWARVES

Possessed of a strength that belies their size, dwarves have flesh infused with stone-a silico-organic hybrid that makes them physically denser than humans or elves. They enjoy a reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings, the long-extinct steel dwarves.

They are the children of the Elder God Ord. A common phrase among the dwarves is "Ord made the world." Their way of saying, "What will be, will be." Dwarves take great pride in knowing that along with Aan, Eth, and Kul, their god created the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see the world and seek glory in Ord's name.

# Tools of the Trade

Those raised within dwarven enclaves have a relationship with technology not found in many other places on Orden. The gifts of the steel dwarves are many in number, but the most prominent is that of pneumatic steam power.

Dwarves have incorporated steam into much of their warfare and weaponry, making them deadly opponents. But like all technology, it's a double-headed hammer. As much as they use steam for destruction, construction is where it truly shines. Creating the formidable and brutalist facades common to dwarven architecture is made much easier with the use of tools designed to utilize pneumatic power. Some of the larger and more metropolitan dwarven cities are rumored to power wealthier districts using steam from geothermal vents.

# Innovative Operation

The dwarves have yet to crack all the secrets of the valok, the autonomous machines that were their ancestors' greatest achievement, but they've made great strides in researching them. They've innovated ways to repurpose, recycle, and reverse engineer (to a limited degree) valok assemblage, giving rise to a new multifaceted occupation: the operator.

Operators now span the world and come from all walks of life, but the first among them were dwarves who built powered suits from excavated valok parts. These suits were initially used for construction and utility purposes, but can be repurposed and refitted for warfare when the need arises.

Word of these wonderous dwarven creations quickly spread among the tunnels of the underground, and up into the overworld. This led to a brief arms race where artisans, craftspeople, and smiths from all over were commissioned by wealthy rulers and aristocrats to create mechanized suits to bolster their armies and personal guard.

# The Press-Gangs of Kal Kalavar

Before Ajax came to power, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar were renowned for their disciplined constabulary. The constables were kind, kept order, and kept the city safe.

But now, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar have submitted to Ajax's rule and pay him tribute in prisoners. Ajax has need of bodies, to be used as either forced labor or as fodder for the Body Banks, whether to make war dogs or grant eternal life to those in Ajax's favor. Most dwarves don't like this deal, but the press-gangs are committed to their work.

The marauder lords who lead the press-gangs make use of salvaged valok communication arrays that they wear like a mohawk on their heads. The array gives them access to magnetomancy, allowing them to shape and levitate metal, including wielding multiple axes in battle.

# Servitor War Walkers

The war walker is a common sight in both dwarven armies and dwarven cities. They vary widely in appearance and make, ranging from cobbled-together heaps of belts, gears, and plates to elegant and sleek marvels of dwarven engineering. In battle, war walkers carry multiple dwarves and keep foes at a distance. In society, they're used for public transit and accessibility needs within dwarven cities.

# Stone Whisperers

Some dwarves are born with an innate talent to communicate with stone. Young dwarves identified with this gift are taken to a secretive enclave where they are trained to manipulate the movement and shape of stones using only whispers. The stone whispering technique is a deadly and quiet force in battle, and often the rumble of stone is the only precursor to an enemy's crushing defeat.

Legends speak of stone singers, dwarves who could move mountains with their song. However, those same legends tell a tale of two stone singers who harmonized their voices and nearly ended the world. This is why today's stone whisperers stay quiet, afraid of their own potential.

# Dwarf Languages

Most dwarves speak Caelian and Zaliac.

**Dwarf Malice Malice Features** At the start of any dwarf's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

s **Breaching Charge 3 Malice** A dwarf can destroy one adjacent object or square of wall for each 3 Malice spent. Each enemy adjacent to the destroyed object or square takes the object's Stamina in damage (3 for wood, 6 for stone, or 9 for metal).

t **Rappelling Barrage 5 Malice** Each dwarf acting this turn can automatically climb at full speed while moving. At any point during this movement, they can make a free strike.

a **Snaring Line 7 Malice** Area, Magic, Ranged Main action e 10 x 1 line within 10 x Each enemy in the area

- **Effect:** Each target makes an Agility test.
- 1 8 damage; restrained (EoT)
- 2 6 damage; slowed (EoT)
- 3 No effect.

The snaring line remains until the end of the encounter. Any enemy who moves into the area for the first time in a round or starts their turn there must make the test.

Special: This ability can't be used by a minion.

| **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 One prone, restrained, or slowed creature** |

| **Ranged, Weapon** | **Maneuver** |

### t **Cupola**

While riding the war walker, three size 1 allies can occupy the same space. Creatures riding the war walker have cover.

Any restrained or slowed creature who comes adjacent to the war walker is automatically restrained (save ends) and takes a bane on power rolls. A creature restrained this way moves with the war walker.

# ELEMENTALS

When the gods formed the mundane world, they took sparks of creation from the roiling plane of Quintessence and gave sentience to some of the multiverse's most basic elements-air, earth, fire, and water. Many elementals contain just one of these components, but can come to embody multiple reagents as they age.

# **Duality of Form**

Elementals are mercurial creatures of creation, destruction, and transformation. Though the deities first created the mundane world, elementals cultivated and shaped it. When a tree, stone, or other aspect of the world doesn't suit an elemental, they break it down with elemental fury then build it anew.

Elementals change like the winds and the tides, and from age to age, they remake themselves to reflect what the world has become. They are protectors armored by stone, lizards ablaze with fire, and sometimes dragons clad in steel.

# **Rebirth and Reformation**

When an elemental dies in the mundane world, their spirit returns to Quintessence, where they must rest for decades to regain their strength. Should the spirit return to the mundane world, they take on a form that reflects a creature or other aspect of that plane.

# **Crux of Fire**

Cruxes of fire, often called blazecasters, take the form of fiery lizards. They commonly live in hot zones of planar convergence or areas of volcanic activity. These territorial elementals usually question interlopers from afar-and if they don't like the answers, they rain down fire before their foes can draw near.

Though many elementals weave their innate gifts into oral storytelling, cruxes of fire are particularly adroit at animating their stories in silhouettes of flame.

#### Essence of Storms

At a distance, most would mistake an essence of storms, sometimes known as a galeweaver, for a large bird of prey. This majestic creature is formed from streaks of colored cloud stuff woven into the silhouette of a large eagle or falcon.

Galeweavers act as scouts for their handlers or for groups of elementals, and they're usually the first to spot trouble. Insatiably curious, an essence of storms often swoops down to talk when they observe travelers.

### **Essence of Tides**

An essence of tides looks like a shimmering blue manta ray that glides over land as easily as through water, earning them the common name of tidedrifter. Most common along coastlines, essences of tides enjoy harmless pranks, especially against folk who regularly sail or swim in their waters.

Tidedrifters have a healthy sense of humor that makes it easy to win their friendship-but their relaxed demeanor evaporates if friends or family face threats.

# **Field of Growth**

The field of growth takes the form of a massive centipede made of vegetation. Often called verdant primevals, these caretakers of the natural cycle of life (and death) fight those they see as upsetting that cycle. Fields of growth seek not only to destroy undead and those who create them, but to sabotage divine servitors who casually peddle resurrection magic.

# **Force of Earth**

A protective earth elemental, a force of earth resembles a nine-foot-tall great ape formed of dirt and rough stone. They act as guardians and historians when among other elementals, working tirelessly to thwart ills from befalling the group. These elementals are sometimes called earthen bulwarks.

# **Elemental Languages**

Most elementals speak Low Kuric. Some can use Caelian when they need to.

### **Elemental Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any elemental's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

★ **Elemental Swa**

**3 Malice**

t **Elemental Swap 3 Malice** Two elementals on the encounter map teleport to swap places, and each has damage immunity 2 until the end of the round.

![user icon] Split

s **Split 5 Malice** An elemental acting this turn cleaves themself into two separate elementals. Each elemental has the same statistics as the original, except that each has half the original's current Stamina and is one size smaller. Both elementals can then shift up to their speed.

### r **Convocation of Chaos 7 Malice**

| **Magic, Ranged** | **Maneuver** |
| --- | ---:|
| **📏 Ranged 8** | **🎯 Self or one elemental** |

**7 Malice**
Maneuver
Self or one elemental

**Effect:** Until the end of the encounter, the target has a +5 bonus to speed and a +5 damage bonus to strikes. Additionally, whenever an elemental within the target's line of effect uses an ability with "Convocation" in the name, the target also gains the effects of that ability.

# It is in changing that we find purpose.

# ELVES, HIGH

The children of the solar celestials, the high elves were created to tend to the sun elves as librarians and heralds. Now they sequester themselves away from the world amid the fallen cities of the sky elves, remembering a better age, before the arrival of humans and war to the world made the high elves who they are today.

#### Glamorous

The high elves hold an unwavering poise worthy of a noble background. They also emit a glamor that allows them to take on physical features and aspects of personality as they desire. Each person sees this glamor slightly differently, emphasizing some details over others based on one's own values and fascinations.

### **Loremasters**

The adage "knowledge is power" is a rough translation of an ancient Hyrallic saying. A closer translation is "knowledge before power." High elves believe knowledge is the pursuit from which all good things flow: life, power, legacy.

In their ruined towers, they study ancient history and magic thought long extinct. They revive dead spells and languages and manipulate their use to suit their means. High elves can use this magic for wondrous creations. They can also use it to kill by lifting a finger.

# **Elemental Summoners**

Through their studies of ancient magic, many high elves have cultivated a strong bond to elemental creatures and can call upon their aid. In service to high elves, soot crows scout from the sky, living vine walls called brambleguards create labyrinthine barricades, and ceramic horses provide fast transport over long distances.

Many high elves can also summon magical wisps called elemental motes. These sprites enervate their foes against high elf magic and revive fallen elementals in a brilliant flash by sacrificing their own energy.

# **Surround and Suppress**

Foes who threaten high elf armies are dealt with quickly and entirely. High elves take advantage of each other's magic to corral enemies together and throw huge waves of destruction upon them. The more exposure a victim has to high elf magic, the more effective that magic is in destroying them. High elf wyrds ensure there's no escape, warping the environment into treacherous pits-and eventually, graveyards.

# **Magical Manipulation**

The high elves practice a tradition of group-casting magic that empowers their abilities as more elves participate. This enables them to extend their spells farther, sometimes even miles away from the caster when an entire platoon works in unison.

Many high elves have also collected extensive libraries of tomes over the centuries. Even on the battlefield, an elf can turn to a book to transform a mundane weapon volley into a magical one.

# **The Unseen Hands**

The Unseen Hands is a sect of high elf radicals who believe they have stumbled upon sky elf texts detailing their downfall at the hands of the sun elves. The story surrounding their purported discoveries has twisted into a narrative decrying modern society for benefiting from the lore accumulated in service to the sun elves. The sect hides among high elf society in plain sight, slowly manipulating nobles as they attempt to dismantle that society and plunge the world into anarchy.

# **The Ordinator**

Being in the presence of a high elf ordinator inspires an ancient fear in those who know high elf history. Occupying a position of both military and clerical authority, an ordinator is capable of focusing a force of high elves to precisely strike an arrow's tip from the other end of the battlefield. These spellcasters are among the most studied elves in their communities and courts, and their strategic minds are matched only by their affinity with elementals. The ordinator is not only an illuminating beacon of command for their platoon; they are a spiritual beacon of hope for their people.

# **High Elf Languages**

Most high elves speak Caelian and Hyrallic, with some also speaking Yllyric.

### **High Elf Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any high elf's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

p **Chaincast 3 Malice** Until the end of the round, whenever a high elf uses a magic ability, they can use it as if they were occupying the square of another high elf on the encounter map to whom they have line of effect.

| **Gift From an Accursed Tome** 2d10 + 2 | **5 Malice**                                |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|

| **Area, Magic** | **Main action** |

| 5 x 1 line within 1  | Each enemy in the area |

**Effect:** The high elf chooses a damage type and condition from one of the following combinations: cold damage and slowed, poison damage and weakened, or corruption damage and frightened.

- 1 5 damage; R <1] chosen condition (save ends)
- 2 9 damage; R <2] chosen condition (save ends)
- 3 12 damage; R <3] chosen condition (save ends)

**Special:** This ability can't be used by a minion.

p **In Defiance of Time 7 Malice** Until the end of the round, each high elf in the encounter gains a +4 bonus to speed, and whenever a high elf uses an ability against an enemy, each high elf adjacent to that enemy can make a free strike against them.

### **The Ordinator is a Magic Beacon**

Whenever a high elf ordinator appears on an encounter map, the Chaincast Malice feature is improved and always active. When any elf uses a magic ability as if they were in the ordinator's space, that ability has a double edge.

**Effect:** Each target can teleport to an unoccupied space adjacent to the palinode. The palinode and each target then gain 5 temporary Stamina.

At the start of each of their turns, the palinode can choose one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw. That effect instead ends at the end of their turn.

######## High Elf Deployments

High elves are obsessed with knowledge: discovering it, documenting it, and protecting it. While this means that many of them are cloistered in towers with noses buried firmly in ancient tomes, lost knowledge is often found in dangerous ruins or in the collections of powerful individuals with no intent to share. When this happens, strike teams of likeminded high elves deploy to infiltrate and "forcefully acquire" such knowledge.

Many high elves also consider themselves guardians of dangerous or forbidden lore and are ready to defend it with their lives. Many illusory groves and glamoured ruins conceal repositories and powerful warriors sworn to keep these secrets out of the hands of those who would use them for ill.

| **📏 Self** | **🎯 The horse's rider** |

**Effect:** The horse vertical slides the target up to 3 squares, ignoring stability. The target can use a ranged ability at any point during this forced movement, and takes no damage if they then fall.

### t **Shared Otherworldly Grace**

If the ceramic horse's rider has the Otherworldly Grace trait, the ceramic horse also has that trait.

# ELVES, SHADOW

Children of the Twilight Celestials, the shadow elves are the native denizens of the parasitic manifold of Equinox, also known as Dusk. Theirs is a world of perpetual twilight, a sun that never rises nor sets, a world that knows neither noon nor midnight.

Equinox is a dying world. The shadow elves plan to use their magic to rewrite Orden's topography, creating a new home with themselves as rulers over all.

#### In Equinox's Shadow

Shadow elves are lit by an unseen sun. In places like Orden, they appear washed out, silhouetted, or grayscale. In Equinox, they have lived in the shadow of their manifold's eternal dusk, making them incompatible with other light sources. Their skills, magic, and weapons do not fare well in the sun. But in turn, they can blend in with existing darkness and dissolve out of sight.

# **Manifold Weaponry**

The shadow elves have mastered the art of combining deep, ancient magic with cutting-edge technology. Their weaponsmiths craft blades of solid shadow that strike and wound in many dimensions at once. A creature hit by one of these blades is injured in multiple worlds at a time. Only a victim of strong mind can compartmentalize and end these effects on their body in the here and now.

#### Brush Stalkers

When the shadow elves invade Orden, they often ride domesticated dwimmerbeasts known as brush stalkers-quadrupeds who carry entire ecosystems on their rack of antlers. Newly born brush stalkers do not survive translation into Orden, so the ones the shadow elves ride are old: overgrown with bioluminescent moss, cracks on their ancient cloven hooves.

A brush stalker's glamor allows them to look like a mundane deer. But when the glamour falls, the creature devours the light around them and plunges their surroundings into darkness.

#### Fractured Factions

Equinox is a small world, ruled by Every Strike of Lightning a Lover Betrayed, the Queen of Shadows. It is her shadow elf scouts and assassins who scour Orden seeking allies who might be persuaded that their lives would be better under a different master. But there are other factions of shadow elves in Equinox. Not all who dwell under the invisible sun seek conquest. Others are sages and pacifists who seek to heal their world or find an empty world somewhere in the timescape to resettle to.

# **Duskcalling**

Certain shadow elf warriors have a natural link to the unseen sun that illuminates their world. With this link, a warrior can perform a Lay: a mix of humming and throat singing that aligns celestial bodies across manifolds. Some Lays can temporarily induce an eclipse on the manifold in which the duskcaller is performing, allowing their comrades to gain the advantage.

A skilled duskcaller can lead a band in a group song powerful enough to recreate the conditions of Equinox for a short time. Some shadow elf factions are researching this connection in earnest, considering it a viable step toward terraforming a second Equinox.

# **Shadow Tactics**

Belief that Equinox is a dying world makes the shadow elves desperate, for soon they'll have no home to retreat to. Their tactics rely on both impenetrable defense and a swift and decisive offense. Since they can't benefit from a home advantage, all warriors are taught to create one. If there are no places to hide, form them. If the light is too bright, remove it.

In many shadow elf societies, all people are given basic combat training and are expected to serve at least one military tour in their life. Those who excel move on to become duskcallers, mournblades, and eclipses: paragons of strength who are venerated by the people. Research and discovery are employed for the primary purpose of furthering military goals. Even the popular children's game hide-and-seek is a military device created to prepare a people for constant, imminent conflict.

#### Shadow Elf Languages

Most shadow elves speak Illyvric, though platoon leaders might speak some Caelian or Hyrallic.

### **Shadow Elf Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any shadow elf's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

t **Watch Me Disappear 3 Malice**

Each shadow elf acting this turn can attempt to hide as a free maneuver if they have concealment.

t **Extra Dimension 5 Malice** When any shadow elf acting this turn makes a strike against a target who has I <2] in addition to the strike's regular effects, the target is bleeding (save ends) or slowed (save ends).

### p **Home Is Where the Hurt Is 10 Malice**

The shadow elves synthesize a concentrated pocket manifold reminiscent of Equinox and graft it onto the encounter map. Until the end of the encounter, all creatures can see shadow elves in full color, and shadow elves no longer benefit from their Of the Umbra trait. Additionally, the potency of all shadow elf abilities increases by 2, and any enemy making a saving throw against an effect imposed by a shadow elf ability must roll an 8 or higher as they feel the effect across two worlds.

######## Shadow Elf Deployments

When under order of the Shadow Queen, shadow elf missions outside of Equinox are usually short, dangerous, and targeted. They rarely last more than a week or two, and the force often appears in Orden not far from their target. Mission goals trend towards the nefarious-kidnapping, assassination, theft, and general skullduggery are the order of the day.

However, not every shadow elf force is affiliated with the queen. Some are exiled rebels plotting their return, others independent groups searching for lost magic to restore their world, and yet others have left Equinox permanently to seek new lives in the caverns and deep woods of Orden. No matter their affiliation, these groups will brook no attempts to thwart their goals and are all deadly warriors.

# ELVES, WODE

Children of the Sylvan Celestials and masters of the elf-haunted wilds for which they are named, wode elves see all forests as their domain by birthright. They know and enjoy their reputation among humans for snatching children who wander too far into the woods. In their eyes, humans *should* fear the trees.

Wode elves' natural ability to mask their presence, called glamor, complements their guerrilla fighting style, letting them strike quickly from cover and then meld back into the underbrush. These traits also make those few wode elves who dwell in cities naturally adept at urban warfare.

#### Heart of the Wode

The primary value of wode elf culture is respect and reverence for their home, the wode in which they live. They speak of the wode as though it is alive and conscious, dangerous and delightful. Wode elves are receptive to strangers who respect the land upon which they trespass. However, those who seek to harm the wilds ruin their only chance of treating peacefully with the wode's beating heart.

# **Wodeworking**

Wode elves practice a secret technique to use the trees of the wode to craft materials as strong as metal, and to create magical plant creatures that serve them, including the wodenelgs, their trusted mounts. To breathe life into these creations, the wode elves lift their voices in song. The more intricate the song, the more durable and autonomous the creation becomes. A wodenelg's rider is typically also its singer, creating a connection between the two that lasts a lifetime.

Legends tell of ancient beings, older than the forests themselves, sung to life by an entire wode elf civilization joined in sixteen-part harmony. These beings outlived their creators, and if they truly exist, they now roam the world as unknown and unknowable guardians who answer to nothing but their final set of instructions.

# **Sylvan Surveillance**

The wode elves' natural connection to the wode allows them to stay aware of the forest's goings-on while inside it. This isn't a telepathic connection, but rather a great understanding of every corner of the wode and a hypersensitivity to changes within it. The stench of a badly set campfire, the sudden squawk of a raven, the forced march of a hungry ant colony: all of this information comes together to form a wode elf's understanding of their surroundings.

A wode elf develops this sense for their home over time, meaning that a wode elf who lives in an urban environment has just as much understanding of the streets, alleys, and structures of their neighborhood as their cousin in the forest does of the deer paths, streams, and trees.

# **Blightless Ambition**

Not all wode elves are happy to negotiate with peaceful interlopers in their realms. Some groups view even the very presence of such intruders as a direct threat to their way of life. One group of hunters known as the Blightless searches the forest for trespassing mortals, seeking to eliminate their potential threat by any means possible. Overzealous and aggressive, the Blightless also focus on expanding their home's boundaries, attacking civilizations close to the forest's edge. Because Blightless attacks constitute the majority of mortal interaction with the wode elves, they set the tone for mortal perception of an otherwise peaceful people.

# **Chirurgeons**

When wode elves in combat control the terrain, their primary strategy is divide and conquer. Chirurgeons (*kai-RUR-jinz*) are master strategists who enact their picture-perfect plans in the thick of battle. Enemies will never know how many wode elves they truly face if the crafty chirurgeon can help it.

#### Warleader

The warleader of a wode elf court is usually their finest tactician. One warleader alone can command dozens of squadrons across miles of forest with such precision that they can appear to predict an enemy's movements without ever laying an eye on them. In times of peace, a warleader's role is primarily that of teacher-a mentor who scouts and soldiers regard almost as an additional parent.

The wode elves send their warleaders into battle only if the situation is dire. Characters who encounter one should be flattered, for the presence of a warleader means the wode elves consider the heroes a formidable threat.

# **Wode Elf Languages**

Most wode elves speak Caelian and Yllyric.

one of the following features.

**Wode Elf Malice Malice Features** At the start of any wode elf's turn, you can spend Malice to activate

t **Forest Network 3 Malice** Each wode elf who ends this turn hidden can shift up to their speed while remaining hidden.

t **Punishing Regrowth 5 Malice** Until the end of the round, each wode elf gains an edge on abilities, and their strikes can slide a target up to 2 squares in addition to their usual effects. If a strike already imposes forced movement, this slide happens after that forced movement. A creature force moved by a wode elf's strike who ends this forced movement in difficult terrain is restrained until the end of their next turn.

p **Vines Everywhere 7 Malice** Vines rapidly grow across the entire encounter map. Each enemy in the encounter makes an **Agility test**. 8 damage; restrained (save ends)

- 1
- 2 Restrained (EoT) 3 No effect.

######## Wode Elf Tactics

Wode elves are at their most powerful in dense and vertical battlefields and tend to bait attackers into disadvantageous fights with false retreats and hidden reinforcements. Not only does this allow them to make full use of their proficiency in concealment and cover but also lets them utilize their climbing skills to gain height advantages. While they prefer taking fights into the deep woods, the elves settle for urban or mountainous areas if the only other option is a wide-open space.

Wode elves are highly mobile and adept at hindering their enemies. A common tactic is to unleash their panoply of slowing and restraining abilities on melee-oriented opponents while harassing ranged combatants with teleports and surprise attacks from off-angles.

# FOSSIL CRYPTIC

The cave-diving humans who first found fossil cryptics initially thought they were the fossilized reanimated skeletons of creatures predating recorded history. When the explorers' priest presented a holy symbol and attempted to turn the cryptics, he learned these fossilized bones aren't mindless undead-and seconds later, he wound up crushed to death by a pillar of stone.

### **Primal Sentries**

In truth, these living fossil amalgamations are inhabited by elemental spirits. Fossil cryptics are found in places of otherworldly beauty with a connection to an elemental plane of Quintessence, often in caves that have remained untouched for eons or whose tunnels are laced with veins of priceless metal in exquisite fractal patterns. Elemental spirits from that plane inhabit the fossils of creatures who once protected the site, carrying on their legacy. Archaeologists, miners, and others who disturb a cryptic's domain are ground into dust and subsumed into the creature's own form.

### **Bones of the Earth**

Though fossil cryptics vary wildly in their chosen shape and form, all contain a central cluster of fossils atop a churning column of rock and metal. With malleable limbs extending from their earthy core, cryptics move with unsettling speed.

### **Ancient Intelligence**


Fossil cryptics often warn trespassers to leave their domains, speaking threats in ancient languages before attacking. Should trespassers persist, cryptics weaponize columns of stone at range and can manipulate the ground around them, pushing and pulling friend and foe alike into the best positions for battle.

### **Fossil Cryptic Languages**

Many fossil cryptics speak Phorialtic, but they are known to also use the ancient languages of the ruins they inhabit.

### **Fossil Cryptic Malice Malice Features**

At the start of a fossil cryptic's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

**3 Malice**

r **Floor Mosaic 3 Malice** The fossil cryptic slides one creature on the ground up to 5 squares. If the creature is prone, this forced movement ignores stability.

### d **Solo Action 5 Malice**

The fossil cryptic takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

### a **Stone Pillars 5 Malice**

**5 Malice**

Two pillars of stone 1 square wide either thrust up out of the ground or jut down from the ceiling anywhere on the encounter map, to a height of up to 5 squares. A creature in the area of a pillar before it appears is knocked prone on its surface. If the creature comes into contact with the ceiling above or the floor beneath the pillar and has m<2] they are restrained (save ends).

p **Choking Dust 10 Malice** The air across the encounter map is thick with dust until the end of the encounter. Each enemy in the dust is suffocating. Additionally, at the end of each round, each enemy in the dust makes a **Might test**.

- 1 Until the end of the enemy's next turn, their stability is reduced to 0, and any forced movement effects targeting them gain a +2 bonus to the distance moved.
- 2 The enemy's stability is halved (EoT).
- 3 No effect.

# GIANTS

Supremely well adapted to harsh environments, giants thrive in extreme conditions. Fire giants build floating cities in the hearts of volcanic calderas, while stone giant villages dot the tallest mountains. Most people often go their entire lives blissfully unaware of the local tribe of giants living atop the nearby mountain range. This is for the best, as few "smallfolk" structures can survive even a handful of sufficiently motivated giants.

#### Adaptable and Elemental

Giants physically resemble the territory they inhabit. A band of frost giants doesn't simply live on a glacial mountain-they're part of that mountain, and it's part of them. Fire giants exude heat like a roaring volcano. Sages have long debated the question, "Does the environment shape a giant, or does the giant shape their environment?"

### **Distant Cousins**

Humanoid scholars generally assume that all giants are related, though giants don't view each other as kin by default. When different giant communities interact, the results depend heavily on the individuals involved and the relationships between their cultures. For instance, stone giants rarely get along with hill giants, as hill giants often detest stone artisanship. Meanwhile, frost giants gladly recruit hill giants into raiding parties if they're willing to be in the vanguard.

### **Fire Giants**

Hailing from sweltering deserts and deep caverns of roiling magma, fire giants embody the passion and ruthlessness of their namesake element. Though they have a reputation for violent growth and expansion, their lesser-known side is a deeply spiritual one, guided by introspection and understanding.

Fire giants rarely wear armor, as their bodies heat to extreme temperatures while they fight, causing leather to melt and metal to deform. They instead hone their own bodies into perfect weapons of war.

### **Frost Giants**

Born of soaring, frigid peaks, frost giants master their environments to rule mountain ranges and build fortresses of unyielding ice. When frost giants march, a blizzard grows overhead, accompanying them like a war banner. To frost giants, battle is a way of life, camaraderie, and glory.

Where frost giants make their homes, a unique form of ice sprouts into flowering crystalline structures. Frost giants harvest this ice, known as *issenblau* in their dialect, and fashion it into weapons as hard and sharp as steel, which can be used in any environment without melting.

### **Hill Giants**

Of all the giant cultures, hill giants are the most likely to interact with humanoids. Hill giants and smallfolk both love to live in places with rolling, fertile fields, and both appreciate the beauty of nature. However, these commonalities can be quickly forgotten if evil hill giants band together to claim the land solely for themselves, or if the smallfolk let fear of the large get the best of them and attempt to drive off their bigger neighbors. Most hill giants want to be left in peace, but when one is pressed, they can demolish a smallfolk village in minutes.

Most hill giants spend so much time in quiet peace that sudden flashy sights and loud noises can draw their attention. In battle, such distractions can draw a hill giant's ire, making them switch from one target to another.

### **Stone Giants**

Fascinated by the act of creation, stone giants carve cities out of ancient caverns, mine precious metals and gems, and craft relics worthy of glory. To many a stone giant, artisanship is the highest calling, and all their creations are crafted with an eye to beauty and longevity.

Stone giants are made of the same kinds of rocks that form their homes-sandstone, marble, granite, and even basalt. Their stone bodies not only protect them from attack, but also provide them with an additional outlet for self-expression. They often carve runes into their skin, which serve a wide variety of artistic and cultural purposes.

### **Giant Languages**

Most giants speak their kind's dialect of High Kuric. Many hill giants also know Caelian.

### **Giant Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any giant's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

### a **Hurl Landscape 3 Malice**

| **Area, Ranged, Weapon** | **Main action** |

**3 Malice**

e 4 cube within 10 x Each enemy in the area

**Effect:** A giant unearths a structure, hazard, or chunk of the encounter map and launches it to fill the area. Each target makes an **Agility test**.

- 1 18 damage; prone and can't stand (save ends)
- 2 14 damage; prone
- 3 9 damage

b **Bellow 5 Malice** Each giant in the encounter takes a deep breath and yells, pushing each creature within 3 squares of them up to 10 squares. A creature who can be pushed by more than one giant is pushed by one giant of your choice.

a **Titanic Tear 7 Malice** A giant creates a fissure along the ground, either in a 15 x 2 line within 1 or a 10 x 3 line within 2, and that opens up to a depth of 6 squares. Each giant in the area can shift into the nearest unoccupied space outside the fissure. Each non-giant in the area makes

### an **Agility test**.

- 1 10 damage; the target falls into the fissure, and is prone and can't stand (EoT)
- 2 10 damage; the target is prone and hanging onto the edge of the fissure
- 3 The target can shift into the nearest unoccupied space outside the fissure.

# GNOLLS

Edacity. The hyena-faced gnolls know only blood and hunger. These fiends carry with them the evil legacy of an unwitting demonic heritage. Originally from the Abyssal Wasteland, gnolls quickly spread across the timescape, and they thrive in deserts, plains, and other sparsely populated places. Though a gnoll's muzzle is just as likely to be bloodied by carrion as by prey, their hunting packs hunger for violence, and they eagerly hunt travelers and raid settlements. A pack's eerie war cry, a wild cackle, presages a night of battle and terror.

# **Born From Blood**

The Abyssal Waste is an alien landscape hostile to most life. Yet amid its desolation, fiendish creatures thrive, including abyssal hyenas-bloodthirsty scavengers who fight with other lesser fiends over the corpses of demons. The first gnolls arose when a pack of those predators lapped at the ichor oozing from the wounds of a dying demon prince, As'sylrak the Warper.

As his last act, the demon gave the fiendish hyenas a demonic cunning to match their insatiable hunger, bound his evil will to theirs, and turned their paws into hands so they could wield weapons. He called these new fiends "gnoll," an Abyssal word that has many meanings, one of which is "to consume completely." And true to their name, the gnolls immediately devoured their creator.

#### Ceaseless Hunger

The merciless gnolls quickly spread across the timescape in search of new victims to quench their never-ending hunger. Their packs were originally followed by some of the abyssal hyenas who didn't receive As'sylrak's blessing, with those tagalongs enjoying the castoffs of the gnoll packs. Gnolls never forgot the day when they tasted immortal flesh-and they hunger for more, longing for a day when they hunt the gods themselves through heavenly halls.

# **Gnoll War**

Most gnolls live for the thrill of the hunt and the taste of flesh, and they aren't choosy with their targets. Perhaps the one saving grace for most humanoid communities is that gnoll war bands constantly battle each other for territory, keeping their numbers reduced.

### **Abyssal Hyenas**

Stronger and smarter than their beastly counterparts, abyssal hyenas crawl out of the Abyssal Wasteland to feed on corpses gnolls leave in their wake. When reinforcements are needed, gnoll spellcasters can use magic to transform abyssal hyenas into gnolls.

### **Tusker Demons**

Towering among the gnolls of a war band, the elephantine tusker demon serves as beast of burden and war machine. Tusker demons have no facial features except a twisted crown of tusks that surrounds their ravening maw. Although they usually follow gnoll commands, tuskers in lethe (see the Demons section) are prone to violent outbursts and charge at anything that moves-enemies and allies alike.

# **Gnoll Languages**

.

Most gnolls speak Tholl. Gnoll carnages and other older gnolls usually also know Variac.

### **Heroes Beware!**

When gnolls go into a frenzy and coordinate their individual Cackletongue maneuvers, few heroes will leave the battlefield unscarred. Any 1st-echelon encounter that contains more than two non-minion gnolls can be considered one difficulty category harder at the Director's discretion.

Area, Ranged, Weapon Maneuver e 1 cube within 3 x Special

| **3 Malice**** | **Maneuver** |

![target icon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/04/Target_icon.svg/1024px-Target_icon.svg.png) Special

**Effect:** A gnoll acting this turn drops an iron-jawed snare into the area. The first time any enemy moves into the area, they make an **Agility test**. If they were unaware of the snare, the test takes a bane. 1 6 damage; bleeding (save ends)

 4 damage; bleeding (EoT)

 No effect.

**Effect:** While an enemy is bleeding this way, each gnoll in the encounter gains an edge on strikes made against them.

### s **Bloodpool 5 Malice**

One gnoll minion suddenly explodes into a pool of blood, splattering the area within 3 squares of them. Any gnoll who starts their turn in this area deals an extra 5 damage on their next strike before the end of their turn. Once per round, an abyssal hyena who starts their turn in the area turns into a **gnoll marauder**, keeping their current Stamina.

### p **Echoes of Laughter 7 Malice**

Until the end of the encounter, the encounter map is encased in a soundscape of laughter and howling. Each enemy takes a bane on the first power roll they make each round. Whenever a gnoll is killed, this effect is suppressed until the start of the next round.

Ranged Triggered action 
| --- | ---:|
| **📏 Ranged 7** | **🎯 The triggering enemy** |

**Trigger:** An enemy within distance deals damage to the tusker. **Effect:** The tusker demon uses the Charge main action and Gore against the target.

### t **Trample**

The tusker demon can move through enemies' spaces at their usual speed. When the tusker enters a creature's space for the first time on a turn, that creature takes 5 damage. The tusker demon can end their turn in a prone size 1 creature's space, preventing the creature from standing up.

### t **Lethe**

While the tusker demon is winded, they gain an edge on strikes, and any strike made against them gains an edge.

# GOBLINS

Known among themselves as *rogabrin*, meaning "more of us" in their Szetch language, goblins are one of the most numerous humanoid species in the world. They can be found across many lands, have developed countless distinct cultures, and dare to venture into environments that few other humanoids are willing to hazard.

Their long arms and prehensile toes make goblins particularly well adapted to environments requiring climbing, and they live equally comfortably in treetop cities as in subterranean realms filled with stalactites, ledges, and chasms. However, just as many prefer to dwell in tight-knit neighborhoods within diverse cities. Many of those goblins who cross swords with adventuring heroes are the worst of their society-thieves and murderers shunned by their own people.

### **Encountered in Groups**

Whether within a society or living in exile, goblins survive and thrive because they work together. A single goblin forced into the wild is terrified. A dozen outlaw goblins are supremely confident-perhaps overly so. Such groups often become bandits who ambush travelers crossing through their territory, be it desert, forest, or underground. Larger goblin hordes might become unscrupulous mercenaries serving powerful villains. No matter how they're encountered, goblins prefer to fight as an overwhelming force and to flee when foes outnumber friends.

### **Goblin Malice Malice Features**

**Malice Features**

At the start of any goblin's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

t **Goblin Mode 3 Malice** Each goblin in the encounter gains a +2 bonus to speed until the end of the round.

### b **Tiny Stabs 5 Malice**

**5 Malice**

Each enemy in the encounter takes 1 damage for each goblin adjacent to them.

p **Swamp Stink 7 Malice**

 **Malice**

The encounter map is covered in a green mist that lasts until the end of the round, and which can't be dispersed by wind. All areas of the map are difficult terrain for non-goblins, and each non-goblin on the map makes a **Might test**.

 5 poison damage; the creature is weakened until the mist disappears.

 The creature is weakened until the mist disappears. 3 No effect.

# **Mobile and Sneaky**

Short, lithe, and long armed, goblins are built for mobility, stealth, and climbing. Goblins who dwell in untamed wilderness and twisting caves utilize their natural agility to hide from threats and flee when found. These crafty skirmishers might run wild through battle, hacking at their enemies' knees, or unleash arrows as they dart from tree to tree.

# **Goblin Magic**

Some exiled goblins forge pacts with evil entities for magical power, including archfey, deities, and fiends. Goblin assassins conjure darkness made from the souls of their victims, while goblin cursespitters hurl magic hexes that keep their enemies at bay.

#### Skitterling

A six-legged winged rodent the size of a housecat, a skitterling moves their clawed feet as they fly, making them appear to scurry through the air. Goblins train these pets to claw at the faces of enemies, as their feet secrete a toxin that causes temporary sluggishness.

### **War Spider**

Goblins ride enormous arachnids as mounts in battle. With blades attached to their legs, a war spider cuts a swath through enemy forces while archers fire from atop a platform on the animal's back. During a raid, a war spider arches their body to launch warriors off their back and into the fray.

### **Worg**

Some goblins form a special bond with worgs-canine creatures raised by many goblin communities as mounts, guardians, and companions. A worg stays loyal to the hand that feeds them, and will protect their handler to the bitter end.

### **Goblin Languages**

Most goblins speak Caelian and Szetch.

**Effect:** The area is filled with a green haze that lasts until the start of the stinker's next turn or until the stinker is reduced to 0 Stamina, and which can't be dispersed by wind. The area is difficult terrain for non-goblins, and each non-goblin who moves in the area takes 2 poison damage for each square moved.

### t **Crafty**

The stinker doesn't provoke opportunity attacks by moving.

# GRIFFONS

With the head, front legs, and wings of a bird and the powerful body and haunches of a feline, griffons are the apex predator's apex predator. Highly territorial with ranges spanning hundreds of leagues, these air-superiority hunters make quick work of any humanoids foolish enough to stumble into griffon lands.

### **Coveted Mounts**

Attempting to capture a wild griffon typically ends in injury or worse, though humanoids who hatch griffons in captivity and raise them from birth find they make loyal companions. Some humanoid cultures raise griffons as mounts for the military or city guard, and griffon eggs can fetch a fine price.

Daring poachers sometimes attempt to steal griffon eggs from wild aeries, but such thieves typically meet their end by beak or talon. So great is the death toll that many localities have outlawed the poaching of griffon eggs.

### **Inaccessible Aeries**

Griffons roost alone or in pairs on craggy mountainsides, in forests, or on cliffs overlooking the ocean. They hide their nests in enormous treetops, scrubby thickets clinging to a cliff, or similarly sheltered nooks that are nearly unreachable for creatures who can't fly. Each aerie holds up to three eggs during brooding season, which lasts for three months starting in the early spring. Chicks hatch after forty days of incubation, then remain in or near the nest as their parents feed them. About forty days after hatching, a griffon chick learns to fly-and after that, it's only a matter of days before they set out from their nest into the wider world, generally making their own nest somewhere nearby.

### **Rare Breeds**

Griffons come in many varieties. While the most common griffon is the leonine eagle, others include a falcon-panther variety, a bearded vulture-clouded leopard variety, and a striped condor griffon that combines the features of condor and tiger. Questions abound as to whether these creatures came about naturally or were fashioned by magic hands, and many scholars offer abundant rewards to adventurers who can bring them evidence of rare or undiscovered griffon types.

### **Griffon Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any griffon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

| **Swoop** | **3 Malice** |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------|

| **-** | **Maneuver** |
| --- | ---:|
| **📏 Self** | **🎯 Self** |

**Effect:** The griffon flies up to their speed, and can make a free strike against each creature who makes an opportunity attack against them during this movement.

### b **Piercing Cry 5 Malice**

A griffon acting this turn unleashes a hideous screech at one enemy within 5 squares of them, forcing that creature to make an **Intuition test**.

 Frightened (save ends) 2 Frightened (EoT) 3 No effect.

### p **Wildwinds 10 Malice**

Winds bluster and blow across the encounter map. Until the end of the encounter, each creature who can't fly or isn't mounted on a flying creature takes a −3 penalty to stability, and any forced movement effect targeting such a creature moves them an additional 5 squares.

### t **Banded Predator**

The griffon can attempt hide even while observed. Additionally, while no enemy has line of effect to them, the griffon can attempt to hide at the end of their turn.

# HAG

When fear of death or hunger for power grips a mortal spellcaster, often a druid or a witch, they might forge a pact with an evil archfey. The mortal becomes a hag-aged, clawed, and cruel. A ruthlessly powerful fey in their own right, a hag uses their magic to bring about the misery their archfey wills.

# **Hiding in Plain Sight**

Though hags typically appear as older humanoids, their true form is as vicious and nasty as their nature. They prefer to show the world a charitable face, but the general wisdom concerning hags is that the more beautiful their appearance, the deeper the rot within. This theory has never been confirmed, however, as few who see a hag's true form live to tell the tale.

### **Dealmakers and Heartbreakers**

As old age can't kill them, the oldest hags accumulate swathes of knowledge, magic, and repute over time. They are happy to share their wares... for the right price. Rather than ask for paltry coin, a hag usually bargains for something dear to the customer-perhaps their ability to love, the sound of their child's laugh, or their left pinky toe.

Adding insult to injury, those who deal with hags almost always discover the product is worse than advertised. Mortals should pay close attention to the precise wording of their agreements, lest they end up with a hex they thought would be a gift. Such curses often lead to the corruption of good but desperate folk, with some getting so twisted up in fey deals that they become hags themselves.

### **What's in a Name?**

Hags give themselves whimsical names, and older hags often select monikers such as Auntie, Uncle, or Nanny. Such relatable names help entice their favorite prey: the innocent. Who would fear Granny Gumdrops or Uncle Twothumbs?

# **Loyal Underlings**

Hags are treacherous by nature, and they only recruit creatures they can trust to be loyal underlings. Most of these creatures lack sapience (such as animals, constructs, and undead), though hags sometimes command weaker fey who are too scared to betray them.

### **Hag Languages**

Most hags speak Anjali, Caelian, Khelt, and Yllyric, with older hags often knowing several more languages.

### **Hag Malice Malice Features**

At the start of a hag's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

### b **Casting Curses and Bodies 3 Malice**

The hag utters terrible words that push each enemy within 2 squares of them up to 3 squares.

### **Hag Goodies**

Hags collect, craft, and trade a variety of trinkets and talismans over the course of their lifetimes. Most of a hag's prized possessions-a stove with living human feet, a porcelain doll that cries real tears, a book that details the reader's most humiliating memories-are of no apparent use to anyone except perhaps for a museum of the macabre, but a few of a hag's baubles are more generally useful.

The following are sample treasures from a hag's hut. A hag might have two or three of these goodies on hand and know how to obtain the others. These items can be found in *Draw Steel: Heroes*.

**Treasures:** Evilest Eye, Imp's Tongue, Float Powder, Buzz Balm

- **Components:** Rare or extinct cooking ingredients, hairpins, gecko tails, roses, werewolf blood
- **Project Sources:** Notes in Khelt for the Awe armor enhancement or the Displacing I implement enhancement, notes in Anjali for Stygian Liquor or a Color Cloak (any color)

# HOBGOBLINS

Also known as demogoblins, hobgoblins descend from ancient goblins who made a pact with an infernal power in exchange for increased size and strength. Each hobgoblin has fang-like tusks and one or more horns protruding from their head.

Many hobgoblin settlements constantly and aggressively test each other's boundaries. This isn't normally a problem for other humanoids, but once or twice every generation, a wicked hobgoblin rallies their people and decides it's time to take over everyone else's lands-THEN it's a problem.

#### Synergized Tactics

Hobgoblin magic and talents complement one another in a fight. Wise commanders put these strategies to good use and scout the battlefield before combat to gain every advantage. Thanks to their emphasis on tactics, hobgoblin armies can hold their own against other forces with ease.

# **Playing With Fire**

The infernal heritage of hobgoblins allows them to live in extreme heat many other humanoids can't tolerate. They often settle in deserts, tropics, and other hot areas. Their heritage also allows them to bend fire to their will, and many choose professions that make use of fire, such as smithing or glassblowing.

# **Innate Magic**

Infernal magic runs through the veins of every hobgoblin, though their gifts vary. Many can harness the power of fire or corruptive energy, while others can teleport across the battlefield or run like the fastest predators.

# **Binding Bargains**

Many hobgoblins still hold to the infernal concept of being true to their word when entering into agreements. Even spoken contracts are considered unbreakable, and hobgoblin communities scorn any creature-hobgoblin or otherwise-who degrades themself by breaking their word.

# **Grilp**

The grilp-a green-skinned devil about the size of a housecat-can change the color and texture of their skin to blend in with their surroundings. They often serve as scouts, spies, messengers, and errand-runners for high-ranking hobgoblins. Beyond the grilp's covert skills, however, hobgoblins value these creatures most highly for their magic-laced saliva, which weakens the defenses of other creatures.

# **Slaughter Demon**

When evil hobgoblins who embrace their fiendish heritage need to wipe an enemy off the map, their war mages ritualistically beseech an archdevil for the service of a grack'tanar, known as a slaughter demon in the Caelian language. Once summoned, this towering, serpent-bodied, six-clawed demon slithers to war alongside the hobgoblins who summoned them.

Devils captured the grack'tanars eons ago. Broken, these demons wait for a call to war, hungry and frothing in the Seven Cities of Hell. Slaughter demons are eager to kill and please their devil captors so they might be sent out again, and they rarely turn on hobgoblins unless they fall into lethe (see the Demons section).

# **Hobgoblin Languages**

Most hobgoblins speak Anjali, Caelian, and Szetch.

### **Hobgoblin Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any hobgoblin's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

- t **Goblin Malice Features 3-7 Malice** The hobgoblin activates a Malice Feature available to goblins.
- t **Operation Goblin Mode 3 Malice** Each goblin in the encounter gains a +3 bonus to speed until the end of the round.
- t **Operation Tactical Swarm 5 Malice** Each hobgoblin in the encounter shifts up to their speed and can take the Defend main action.
- p **Operation Earth Sear 7 Malice**

Until the end of the round, the ground throughout the encounter map becomes blazing hot. Any enemy takes 1 fire damage for each square of the ground they enter. Any enemy who ends their turn on the ground has fire weakness 2 until the start of their next turn.

# HUMANS

Humans flourish in every habitable part of the world, from inviting coastal cities to unforgiving mountainous terrain. While most humans live quietly in peaceful communities, some are drawn to adventure by an unquenchable thirst for excitement or power.

### **Villains and Heroes**

Recognizing their limited lifespans, humans often set their eyes on immortality. They unfurl empires at the tip of a sword, sacrifice lives to erect grand monuments, and even aspire to godhood, all in hopes that their names will be remembered forever.

Violence and greed are close cousins in the human family. Those with power and wealth often strive for more with might or magic. Others turn to theft, sometimes driven to desperation by rapacious neighbors. Travelers in human lands are likely to encounter robbers and barons both seeking to exact a toll.

Other humans pursue power more subtly, turning their cunning toward selfish ends. When ambitions exceed circumstances, there is always some ancient evil power to call on. Cultists seek fell power in exchange for service, sacrificing to forbidden gods and courting apocalypse.

Fortunately, many humans devote themselves to righting wrongs and reshaping the world for the better. Human heroes plunge themselves into danger time and time again, standing against natural and supernatural perils in pursuit of justice.

# **Risks and Rewards**

Humans devote as much attention to games and gambling as to more serious pursuits. Perhaps this competitive nature explains their renowned knack for seizing the moment-knowing when to risk all on a throw of the dice. Whether in sport or battle, humans quickly spot their opponent's mistakes and seize the advantage.

Humans see unrealized potential everywhere, whether envisioning an untamed forest transformed into a prosperous village, or an ancient dungeon yielding chests filled with coins. Pursuing such ambitions might end in catastrophe, but for these gamblers, it's a game worth playing.

### **Swords for Hire**

With an appetite for warfare and gold, human adventurers are well represented in most mercenary bands. A human mercenary makes a stout ally... if you can afford their price.

#### Connected to the Natural World

Humans are connected to the natural world in a way that many other folk are not. As such, they have an uncanny knack for detecting when nearby creatures, objects, and phenomena have been created by magic and psionics. This same sense allows them to resist supernatural effects.

### **Human Languages**

Most humans speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.

### **Human Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any human's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

# KINGFISSURE WORM

Named for their infamous hunting technique, kingfissure worms terraform the earth as they move, building tunnels and crevasses to accommodate their enormous form. They then lie in wait deep underground. Seasoned adventurers know to be wary when traveling past even the smallest crack in the earth. For when a worm senses the vibrations of their prey above, they shoot their multiple serpentine tongues through the crevasses, dragging prey from the surface into their cavernous maw.

# Intestine Inventory

The kingfissure worm eats indiscriminately, swallowing creatures, structures, and precious gems alike. The wealth inside a kingfissure worm would put any dragon's hoard to shame, though the worm cares nothing for treasure and knows nothing of the spoils lodged in their labyrinthine intestines. Few people have managed to claim the treasure lost to the inside of a kingfissure worm, but stories enough have spread to draw scavengers, bandits, and even armies to the corpses of recently slain worms, all hoping to come away with a king's ransom in spoils.

# Home Renovators

Most worms build a den of tunnels and fissures, remaining in that lair for as long as the pickings on the surface are good and they aren't disturbed. When a kingfissure worm seeks a new home, they target areas with abundant food-occasionally leading to villagers waking up to find their surrounding lands have been terraformed overnight. Residents of such lands generally have two choices: pack up and leave or prepare for battle. If a worm is somehow defeated, all manner of creatures and communities try to lay claim to the worm's underground structures. These empty dens make wonderful war bunkers, isolated workshops, and even highly defensible villages.

# Unstoppable Force

The kingfissure worm is a species determined to outrun, outlast, and out-eat every other living creature. Though the monster might be slowed by a display of great power, only death stops them. Once they have set their sights on their prey, they single-mindedly pursue it regardless of terrain or circumstance. The only thing that gives a kingfissure worm pause are attacks on their tongues, which are left vulnerable when they are dragging creatures to their impending doom.

# Unclear Origins

Kingfissure worms have no identifiable sexual characteristics and are extremely territorial. If two kingfissure worms encounter each other, the result is always a cataclysmic duel that ends in one devouring the other. Because of this, most scholars theorize that these creatures reproduce asexually-and that when a kingfissure worm dies, their tongues detach and grow into full-fledged worms. While this has yet to be confirmed, juvenile kingfissure worms have been seen in the wild, most often spotted following animal herds or traveling communities, feeding off of stragglers, refuse, remains, and vermin.

# Swallowed Survivors

Kingfissure worms never stop growing, and the oldest are truly immense, easily mistaken in the distance for a strangely mobile mountain range. Deep within the bowels of these behemoths, unusual biomes and oversized gut fauna may flourish. In fact, some people who have survived their trip down the gargantuan gullet of one of the great worms have been able to eke out a life-and even form thriving communities-safe inside the spacious lower abdomen of their living quarters.

# Sensitive Giant

For all their might and vitality, kingfissure worms are primarily ambush hunters, and like any ambush hunter, they need delicate and precise senses to detect and target their prey when it approaches. As burrowing creatures, they have a finely tuned sense of touch able to detect even the most minute vibrations while in direct contact with earth and stone. This fills the role of their primary sense, and their rudimentary eyesight leaves them dreadfully nearsighted. In combination, their poor vision and reliance on ground-conducted vibrations means that they have almost no way of pinpointing flying creatures, and many species of birds find kingfissure worm territory exceptionally safe and free from predators.

### **Kingfissure Worm Malice Malice Features**

At the start of a kingfissure worm's turn or when an action's trigger occurs, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

| **📏 Self** | **🎯 Special** |

**Trigger:** A tongue takes damage that doesn't reduce it to 0 Stamina. **Effect:** The kingfissure worm deals 5 damage to the creature or object the tongue had grabbed, releases that creature or object, then pulls the damaged tongue back into their mouth.

### t **Seismic King**

The kingfissure worm has line of effect only within 3 squares. However, they ignore concealment for creatures touching the ground and don't need line of effect to use abilities against those creatures.

### t **Swallowed**

A creature swallowed by the kingfissure worm is restrained and takes 1d6 acid damage at the start of every turn. If the worm takes 25 or more damage in a single round from swallowed creatures, they immediately regurgitate all creatures they have swallowed, who land prone in unoccupied spaces within 3 squares of the kingfissure worm.

### t **Titanic Tunneler**

The kingfissure worm can burrow through stone. When the worm burrows, they create a stable size 3 tunnel in the squares they move through.

### t **Unstoppable Crawler**

# KOBOLDS

Kobold communities, called legions, are found in every biome and across the timescape. Gravitating toward powerful allies and defensible locations, kobolds are equally common in walled cities, secluded temples, subterranean tunnel-mazes, and dragon lairs. Most legions strive to be good neighbors or to go entirely unnoticed, but when a community falls under the sway of a malevolent wyrm or power-hungry kobold centurion, they can pose a significant threat.

### **Defensive Masters**

In a world filled with bigger, hungrier creatures, kobolds survived by becoming experts in collective defense. Kobold shield tactics are legendary, with every warrior carrying a shield into battle and soldiers defending each other in tightly choreographed formations. More than a tool, a kobold's shield is a symbol of their commitment to defending their legion, and they decorate these treasured possessions with battle trophies and illustrations of great deeds.

Kobold legionaries might join worthy adventurers as retainers, lending their defensive prowess to their new allies as they ko-boldly go where no kobold has gone before.

### **Unconventional Tactics**

Relentless innovators, kobolds can easily outsmart anyone who doesn't take them seriously. Their foes haven't experienced a true kobold battle until they survive exploding javelins or flaming nets. Kobold homes are protected with deadly hazards and ambush points. In open warfare, legions deploy iron dragons and flaming spike pit traps (see the Dynamic Terrain section).

### **Tiny Dragons**

Most kobolds believe their ancestors were created by powerful dragons-and with sharp, angular features and prominent dorsal crests, they certainly look the part! Newborn kobolds have brilliant, pearlescent scales, but as kobolds age, their scales dim and mottle. Owing to a deep magical connection, a legion that lives in the domain of a dragon adopts the color of that dragon's scales over several generations.

### **Domain Expansion**

When kobolds settle into the domain of a dragon, they grow more like that dragon in other ways than just coloration. Some groups worship the dragon as a god. Others revere them as an ancestor or a leader, or admire them like a really, REALLY big sibling. This manifests as a desire to understand the dragon's affinity so as to embody it. Kobolds see themselves as an extension of the domain, working with and for it. Meteor kobolds, for example, rely more on hanging traps. Bloodthirsty omen kobolds deny themselves material pleasures and might end up wasting away into little more than skeletons. It has been speculated that kobolds living in a domain influence the strength of the dragon's hold on the territory.

#### Kobold and Dragon Symbiosis

Most dragons are solitary creatures, but kobolds living in a dragon's domain provide both parties with clear benefits. A dragon can establish their domain over an area in half the time if they allow kobolds to settle in the area as well. Meanwhile, a kobold who spends 1 week or more living in the domain of a dragon becomes immune to the hazardous and negative effects of that domain. The kobold's physical appearance might also change the longer they stay in the area.

#### Terrain Mastery

The kobolds' affinity for their terrain, creative tactics, group defenses, and innovative spirit gives a kobold legion mastery of the area in which they live. Though they employ traps and tricks of their own creation, kobolds also know the ins and outs of nature's traps. For example, a sagittarion might shoot at a nearby hive of angry bees instead of their opponent. If your kobold opponents retreat over desert sands or a frozen lake, don't give chase. They likely know something you don't about these terrain hazards.

### **Cute Pets**

The gummy brick is a deadly ooze-a monster shaped of acidic goo and driven by endless hunger. But when properly trained, kobolds find these mindless predators good company. They also love the company of shieldscale drangolins-draconic pangolins-who they train to dig residential tunnel networks, neutralize enemy fortifications, and burrow up into the center of an enemy camp with a dozen kobold minions at their side.

### **Kobold Languages**

Most kobolds speak Kethaic and can understand Caelian.

# LIGHTBENDER

Lightbenders prowl deserts, plains, forests-any sunbathed wilderness where they can take advantage of the adaptations that make them skilled daylight predators. This monstrous creature's fur bends and refracts light from the surrounding environment, producing mirages that distract and confuse their prey.

### **Hidden Hunters**

At a distance, a lightbender looks akin to a regular lion, but closer inspection reveals their glowing eyes, iridescent mane, and a pair of lashing tails spiked with refractive crystals. The lightbender's pelt magically warps light around them to disguise their movement, letting them teleport while leaving behind a past visual imprint. Unsuspecting prey rarely realize they're staring at an afterimage of the lightbender until the predator pounces.

### **Ghostly Echoes**


Lightbenders can also bend the sounds they make, enabling them to almost completely disappear during a hunt. Many can delay their footsteps to slip into a silent prowl, while others might throw a guttural trill across a field to lure prey out of hiding. The lightbenders' illusory mastery was said to inspire several techniques taught to shadows within the College of the Harlequin Mask.

### **Protective Companions**

Though lightbenders are typically solitary creatures, they sometimes cross into another lightbender's territory to help protect a newborn litter of kittens. A few people have succeeded in taming lightbenders as guards or hunting beasts, and if treated well, they can make loyal protectors, often viewing their smaller humanoid companions as surrogate kittens.

### **Lightbender Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any lightbender's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

t **Silent Prow 3 Malice** Each lightbender acting this turn can teleport up to their speed as a move action and attempt to hide as a free maneuver, all until the start of their next turn.

### t **Duplicate 5 Malice**

**5 Malice**

Each lightbender acting this turn can create a duplicate lightbender in an unoccupied space adjacent to them. The duplicate is indistinguishable from the lightbender except by supernatural means, has 1 Stamina, and has the lightbender's speed. A duplicate acts on the lightbender's turn but can take only move actions. Once per round before or after using an ability, a lightbender can trade places with any lightbender duplicate.

### b **Everything the Light Touches 7 Malice**

Each lightbender in the encounter shines radiantly, distorting the senses of any enemy within 5 squares of them. Each affected enemy makes a **Reason test**.

 The target doesn't have line of effect to any lightbender (save ends).

 The target doesn't have line of effect to any lightbender (EoT). 3 No effect.

# LIZARDFOLK

Lizardfolk prefer warm, tropical climates, but they're willing to settle in any humid region-the more moisture in the air, the better. Even in colder environs, lizardfolk can be found in any sufficiently marshy environment. Bogs and wetlands are particularly common nesting grounds.

#### Homeland Protectors

Lizardfolk aren't especially hostile unless they feel their territory is threatened-which it often is. Respectful travelers entering lizardfolk territory, however, find no great hardship. Lizardfolk cultures often focus on a specific trade, such as boat building, fletching, navigating, or weaving, and sell their services to travelers in need, including lizardfolk from other places.

Adventurers often cross paths with lizardfolk while trekking through their homelands. The reptilian humanoids watch travelers who skirt too close to sources of food and shelter, attacking those who take more than they need. Many lizardfolk dwell in abandoned ruins and caverns for protection. Treasure seekers who delve into these places are typically given one warning before the attack begins.

# **Focused and Loyal**

Most lizardfolk speak plainly, viewing blunt honesty as a sign of respect. When they make a vow or personal promise, they do all they can to honor that word. Lizardfolk who swear to destroy an enemy follow their quarry to the ends of the earth.

#### Marshland Tyrants

In times of crisis, such as a food shortage, an evil lizardfolk leader can exploit the emergency, oppressing others in the name of defending their territory. But there are always other local lizardfolk tribes who oppose such aggressive, expansionist posturing, and they often seek the aid of other folk who value freedom from tyranny.

### **Lizardfolk Tactics**

Lizardfolk prefer to fight in or near water whenever they can, and if they aren't on a battlefield with water, they perform delaying actions to buy time while they flood the battlefield with their Malice features before attacking with full force. If water is already present, they focus on positioning in the early battle to surround and split up their opponents.

With a wide array of strong grab and forced movement abilities, lizardfolk tactics are that of divide and conquer, locking down strong defenders while abducting and isolating backline heroes. Lizardfolk also have strong teamwork features and rotate units who have lost their tails to more rear positions in favor of healthier units.

### **Lizardfolk Sample Encounters**

- ¥**Marsh Hunters, 18 EV:** Eight shellguard, eight tonguers, one scaletooth
- ¥**Ambushers, 24 EV:** Sixteen grunts, two skyterrors
- ¥**Scalesworn Detachment, 30 EV:** Eight shellguard, sixteen tonguers, one scaletooth, two bloodeyes
- ¥**War Party, 48 EV:** Eight shellguard, eight grunts, eight tonguers, one scaletooth, one skyterror, one bloodeye, one deathrex

# **Lizardfolk Languages**

Most lizardfolk speak Caelian and their own dialect of Khamish.

### **Lizardfolk Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any lizardfolk's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

| **Net Trap**<br>Area, Ranged, Weapon<br>Image: cube with ruler 1 cube within 3 | **3 Malice**<br>Maneuver<br>Image: circular arrow Special |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|

**Effect:** A lizardfolk acting this turn sets up a net trap into the area. The first time an enemy steps into a square with a net trap, they make an **Agility test**. If the creature was unaware of the trap, they take a bane on the test.

 Restrained (save ends).

 Restrained (Eot).

 No effect.

**Effect:** Any creature not also restrained by a net trap who is adjacent to a creature restrained by the trap can free them as a maneuver.

### a **Water Pit 5 Malice**

A lizardfolk acting this turn unearths a magical size 2 pit that is 2 squares deep and filled with water. Any lizardfolk who moves into, then exits the pit on their turn gains 10 temporary Stamina, regrows their tail if applicable, and ends one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw. While adjacent to the pit, any creature who can burrow or who has the Nature skill can make a **Might test** or a **Reason test** to drain it.

- 1 The creature falls into the pit and is knocked prone.
- 2 The creature fails to empty the pit.
- 3 The pit empties of water.

### p **Flood the Shores 7 Malice**

Waist-high water floods the entire encounter map. Any lizardfolk submerged in water gains an edge on abilities and doubles their speed while swimming. If there are no open water pits on the encounter map, the water drains away at the end of the round.

# MANTICORE

A weary traveler hears a call through the forest or friendly voices from a rocky shelter, and their heart leaps at the promise of refuge-only to find themself at the mercy of serrated teeth and poisonous spikes. In a manticore's territory, people go missing without a trace. These fearsome creatures carve out their hunting grounds in forests near small villages, mountain passes where caravans travel, and other locations with plentiful wildlife. Though manticores can subsist on a carnivorous diet of any nearby prey, their choicest meal is humanoid flesh.

### **Uncanny Appearances**

A manticore has a lion's body, a dragon's wings, and a scorpion's tail barbed with spines, but their most unnerving trait is their humanoid face. Owing to a quirk of magical evolution, manticores develop the features of common ancestries that populate their region of birth. For example, a manticore in an area densely populated by devils inherits fiendish eyes and devilish horns. Manticores are born with an inherent understanding of a regional language, but they can speak only through mimicking that which they've heard-a talent manticores use to lure in prey.

# **Heralds of Death**

Manticores have a magical howl like a trumpet blast. This haunting sound unnerves and terrifies creatures, making them more susceptible to the manticore's bite. While on the hunt, manticores often take to the skies, shooting poison-tipped spikes from their tail to weaken their victims before howling and closing in.

### **Ferocious Companions**

A manticore who develops a taste for humanoids can rarely be tamed. But a young manticore who has yet to cut their teeth on such flesh can be raised into a fearsome ally. Even after a trained manticore companion finally tastes delicious humanoid flesh, they typically remain loyal to their caregiver.

# **Manticore Languages**

Most manticores can mimic Caelian and one language commonly spoken in the region where they dwell. Except in rare cases, manticores don't communicate in full sentences and are too driven by hunger to engage in negotiation.

### **Manticore Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any manticore's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

### p **Uncanny Mimicry 3 Malice**

The manticore uses their mimicry in an attempt to unnerve one creature within their line of effect. If the target has r<4], they take a bane on power rolls against the manticore (save ends). Each time this feature is used against the same target during the encounter, its potency decreases by 2.

d **Solo Action 5 Malice** The manticore takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

### p **Desperate Howl 5 Malice**

The manticore lets out an unnerving cry. Each enemy within the manticore's line of effect makes an **Intuition test**. 1 Frightened (save ends) 2 Frightened (EoT)

 No effect.

### b **Barrage of Barbs 7 Malice**

The manticore sprays tail spikes across the ground within 5 squares of them. Each enemy in that area who has a<3] is bleeding (save ends). Additionally, the area is difficult terrain, and any enemy takes 3 poison damage for each square of the area they enter. An enemy who takes 9 poison damage this way on one turn is weakened until the end of the encounter.

### d **Solo Monster**

End **Effect:** At the end of each of their turns, the manticore can take 10 damage to end one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw. This damage can't be reduced in any way.

Solo Turns: The manticore can take two turns each round. They can't take turns consecutively.

### t **Agile Predator**

Whenever the manticore deals damage to a creature, they don't provoke opportunity attacks from that creature during that turn.

Additionally, any creature weakened by the manticore's Tail Spike ability has their speed halved and takes an extra 3 poison damage at the start of each of their turns.

### **Manticore Treasures**

Although manticores have no earthly use for treasure, they tend to collect a lot of it-it comes attached to the humanoids they prey on. Since manticores drag their victims back to their cave lairs to feed, a manticore's cave is typically strewn with bones, broken weapons, coins, and other relics of unfortunate travelers. After a while, a manticore abandons its cluttered lair in favor of a fresh one, leaving unguarded treasure for anyone willing to explore manticore-infested wastes.

The following are sample treasures from a manticore's cave, of which a manticore might have one or two. These items can be found in *Draw Steel: Heroes.*

**Treasures:** Blade of the Luxurious Fop, Bull Shot, Stop-'n-Go Coin

**Components:** Adamatine spearheads, a mirror blessed by a priest, pixie wings

**Project Sources:** Notes in Zaliac for the Warding II armor enhancement, notes in Khelt for the Celerity implement enhancement, notes in Variac for an Onerous Bow

**Wealth:** If the heroes follow blood trails back to a nearby abandoned caravan, each hero earns 1 wealth

# MEDUSA

Hunted as monsters with no thought given to their nature or origin, medusas are some of the most underestimated and misunderstood creatures. Many people fear medusas for their monstrous appearance and ability to turn others to stone, but few realize the truth. Each of these monstrosities was once a humanoid, cursed and transformed for defying a god. But while some medusas embrace wickedness, many simply fight for their lives against those who threaten them through their ignorance.

### **Cursed for Defiance**

When a powerful mortal defies a god for good or for ill, agents of that deity might curse them to live as a medusa. The offender's skin and eyes become reptilian, and a nest of black venomous snakes replaces their hair. When the medusa wishes, beams from their eyes can slowly petrify others to stone.

Followers of the gods who imposes this punishment spread terrifying myths about medusas, causing mortals to attack and shun them. This often drives medusas into solitude, or to places haunted by creatures who don't judge them based on mere appearance and horror stories. Many medusas plot ways to break their curse, searching for lost healing rituals or secrets to use against the gods who cursed them. Others embrace their new gifts, building stone gardens of the aggressors who foolishly hunted or harmed them.

### **Petrification**

Petrification can take a character out of the game permanently. If you want to give the heroes a chance to recover an ally petrified after an encounter with a medusa, you can let them use the Find a Cure downtime project in *Draw Steel: Heroes* to discover an ancient ritual that can return a petrified creature to life. Alternatively, a medusa might have the power to reverse the state of a petrified victim if left alive, or there might be a temple nearby with a priest who knows how to cure petrification... for a price.

### **Serpentine Reflexes**

While the medusa's stone gaze is legendary, they can move, strike, and evade as swiftly as a snake, even briefly manifesting scaled wings to dart through the chaos. This enhanced dexterity makes them difficult to pin down. Their petrifying gaze allows them to attack at range as necessary, but they're equally deadly in melee, where they have the full advantage of their snakes and the enervating venom pulsing through each snake's set of needlelike fangs.

### **Baleful Magic**

Medusas have many means to defend themselves, even aside from their petrifying stare. They slow enemies down, weaken them, and can even temporarily charm and control them once petrifying magic takes root in their veins. These reclusive beings are no stranger to being outnumbered and overwhelmed. All they have in their power to gain leverage over their opponents, they wield ruthlessly.

### **Stone Gardens**

Medusas often reside in stone gardens filled with statues of those who previously tried to slay them. This not only allows them to slip between their statues, hide, and then strike, but it also allows them to command the battle while in their lairs, shattering statues to harm others. Evil medusas sometimes slowly reverse the petrification of their victims one limb at a time to feed on them, creating grotesque mausoleums of the crumbling dead for unwitting adventurers to wander into.

### **Lifting the Curse**

Agents of the deity who ordered a medusa's curse can sometimes be convinced to lift the punishment, usually in response to the medusa undertaking an impossible task in the god's name or making a threat that can't be ignored. Some sages claim that ancient rituals can undo the curse, but these lost secrets are often hidden by wrathful divine servants-and performing such a ritual might entail great sacrifice.

### **Medusa Languages**

Medusas can speak any language they knew before they were cursed. Many of them speak Caelian, and others have learned the languages of monsters and creatures they dwell near. Additionally, tales tell of some medusas who speak the original form of Khamish.

### **Medusa Malice Malice Features**

At the start of a medusa's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

### a **Shatter Victims 7 Malice**

The medusa causes three stone statues within 10 squares of them to each shatter in a 2-cube explosion. Each enemy in one of those areas makes a **Might test**. An enemy restrained or slowed by the medusa's Petrify ability has a double bane on the test.

# MINOTAURS

The fearsome minotaur is a study in contrasts. Their imposing humanoid body is muscular with patches of thick hair. Their head is that of a massive horned bull, and their soft eyes convey a soulful intelligence mingled with smoldering intensity.

# Primal Rage

Minotaurs burn with fury. Some constantly desire to unleash this destructive energy on the world, and they attack anyone or anything that crosses their path. Others make it a point of pride to control their rage, only fighting when survival demands it. Regardless, once combat begins, minotaurs relish charging at foes with their great horns. In the heat of battle, a minotaur charges from one foe to the next, only retreating if victory is impossible.

# Labyrinthine Origins

The first minotaur was once the human warrior Thesia "The Bull" Danaria, who dared challenge the Beast Lords of Kham. When her revolution was crushed, the Lords of Kham used their beastmagics to twist Thesia's mortal body into a human-bull hybrid prone to fits of violent rage. The Beast Lords placed this minotaur at the center of a vast labyrinth and sent captured rebels to attack the monster. Many fell to Thesia's anger-until a prisoner named Velathri took a chance, speaking to the minotaur instead of brandishing steel. He befriended Thesia, and in retribution, the Beast Lords made him a minotaur as well. This act was their undoing, for Thesia and Velathri fell in love.

New minotaurs were born, and decades later, hundreds charged out of the maze together. These minotaurs reduced Kham to ruins, then they spread far and wide, fearing reprisal from neighboring lands. Even today, many minotaurs shun civilization, preferring to live in winding canyons, twisting ruins, bewildering dungeons, or other labyrinthine terrain where they can continue to hunt. However, small numbers of minotaurs can be found in nearly any terrain or settlement.

## Deep Bonds

Even evil minotaurs can be fiercely loyal friends, gladly charging into certain death for those they trust. These chosen friends never suffer the creature's ire-but gods help them if they betray the minotaur.

## Minotaur Languages

Most minotaurs speak their own dialect of Khamish.

### **Minotaur Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any minotaur's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

s **Bull Rush 3 Malice** For each 3 Malice spent, one minotaur acting this turn gains a +4 bonus to speed and ignores difficult terrain until the start of their next turn.

### s **Cut the... Nonsense! 5 Malice**

One minotaur acting this turn halves any damage they take, and can use the Knockback maneuver as a free triggered action whenever an enemy comes adjacent to them, all until the start of their next turn.

b **Bullseye 7 Malice** All minotaurs in the encounter fill the area around them with psychic impressions of feeling lost and isolated. Each enemy within 5 squares of a minotaur is teleported up to 5 squares and makes an **Intuition test**.

- 1 The target has line of effect only within 3 squares and is frightened of all minotaurs (save ends).
- 2 The target has line of effect only within 3 squares (EoT). 3 No effect.

### t **Swarm**

The stampede can move through spaces as if they were a size 2 creature, and can occupy other creatures' spaces. At the start of each of the stampede's turns, they can make a free strike against each creature whose space they share .


# OGRES

Massive and bull-necked with bulging muscle and flesh, most ogres indulge their every impulse because few can stop them. Though small for giants, ogres outweigh and tower over humanoids. Most live in the wild where they can create their own rules and ways of life.

# Extreme Emotions

Most ogres experience emotions at their extremes. Rarely are they simply bemused or cross, and one is more likely to find an ogre leaping with ecstatic joy over a trivial victory or screaming with murderous rage over everyday frustrations. These heightened feelings drive many ogres down selfish paths, and some take whatever they want from anyone too weak to protest. Other ogres can be manipulated into working for evil creatures who promise to meet their heart's desire, be it food, riches, or friendship.

Ogres who embrace good often dedicate themselves to inspiring causes, letting their emotions fuel their passion and dedication for protecting their chosen people or place.

# Savory Stories

Some ogres speak of a time when they shared vast wealth and riches, great homes made of hewn stone, and sumptuous feasts. These stories always end tragically, each with a different villain-from deceptive mages to talking cats-swindling the ogres of what is rightfully theirs. The truth of such legends remains unknown, but many cruel ogres use them as an excuse for their selfish indulgences.

# Aristocracy of Bullies

When wicked ogres gather more food than they can stomach or riches than they can spend, they use the excess to tempt their kin into working for them. These petty rulers make other ogres grovel at their feet for table scraps, then send them out into the world to steal more. Many ogre communities form around these arrogant aristocrats-but few such leaders die of old age, as the ambition and emotions of their subjects bring about violent ends.

# Cyclops: Ogre Progenitor

Ogres originally descended from the cyclops, an old-world giant with a single eye whose kind still roam through remote canyons and valleys. These behemoths stand heads above the ogres and are twice as destructive once they've spotted their prey. But while their binocular cousins have gone on to become successful hunters and live for themselves, the cyclops is a scavenger hindered by their poor eyesight. Most cyclopses are eager to work for and defend powerful warlords or wealthy ogres, as long as they have easy access to food and shelter.

Rumor has it that a cyclops can emit a mile-long energy ray from their eye. However, focusing such power is nearly impossible when their vision is usually too irritated and clouded by dirt.

# Ogre Languages

Most ogres speak Caelian and High Kuric.

### **Ogre Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any ogre's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

### b **Shockwave 3 Malice**

One ogre acting this turn jumps and lands on their rear, causing a 3 burst shockwave. Each size 1 creature in the area makes a **Might test** or **Agility test**.

- 1 5 damage; vertical push 3
- 2 4 damage; vertical push 2
- 3 Push 1

p **Bully 5 Malice** Each ogre in the encounter shifts up to their speed and can make a free strike. If they can, they gang up on the same target rather than picking different targets.

t **Rampage 7 Malice** Until the end of the round, each ogre has damage immunity 5 and deals an extra 5 damage with abilities, and heroic abilities that target any ogre have their Heroic Resource cost reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1).

# OLOTHEC

Protean in form, beings of nearly pure intellect, the Old Ones think in alien geometric logic. Their name for themselves is unrecorded, but sages believe they are the oldest beings in the timescape and simply call them "The Old Ones." Synlirii refer to them as olothec (*OH-luh thek*)-"ancient enemies." But some humanoid scholars have noted this term bears an uncanny similarity to another archaic synlirii word meaning "ancient ancestor."

# Immortal Evil

Across countless cultures and ancestries, olothec feature in nightmares and temple friezes alike. While their origins are obscure and may never be known, their hatred of the mundane world and every living thing in it is well recorded. Olothec channel psionic energy beyond any mortal power, surpassing even the voiceless talkers. To them, a living creature who can't reshape their own flesh is repugnant, an unnatural abomination requiring eradication-or transformation.

# Agents of Chaos

Olothec consider the primordial chaos that spawned them as the ideal state of existence. They have long warred against the voiceless talkers, loathing their constant manipulation and refinement of evolutionary forces. Where olothec lair in forgotten sea tunnels and beneath ancient ruins, they surround themselves with slime servants-humanoids, beasts, horrors, and others, all devolved to a perfect physical and mental state.

# Primordial Form

At first sight, an olothec seems like little more than a rippling mass of tentacles, twisting around each other like a shifting shroud. Creatures who get too close discover each of those tentacles ends in a ravenous mouth set with razor-sharp teeth. Each mouth is tipped by a cluster of three eyes that focus the olothec's relentless attacks. In water or on land, fetid slime coats the horror, protecting them against attackers and acting as a conduit for their fearsome psionic power.

# Mutations of the Flesh

Millennia of practice have allowed olothec to perfect psionic abilities that devolve and transform their victims into primordial life forms. Exposure to the psionic slime of an olothec's tentacles can change a creature into a mindless, oozing thrall. The most powerful olothec have unique powers that further warp flesh.

# Olothec Languages

Most olothec communicate telepathically using Mindspeech and speak Urollialic. Many also know Old Variac and Caelian, but converse in those languages only when necessary.

### **Content Warning: Body Horror**

Most olothec are creatures of incomprehensible evil who use their psionic might to reshape the flesh of their enemies. Their stat blocks contain strong elements of body horror. You should feel free to modify any of these effects for the safety of you and your players.

- 3 20 psychic damage; a<4] grabbed

**Effect:** The olothec can pull a target grabbed this way adjacent to them. While grabbed this way, a target can't make saving throws to end any other effects, and the olothec has a double edge on strikes against them.

### b **Memory of Chaos 6 Malice**

The olothec broadcasts their memory of the universe in its primordial state-a sweeping cacophony of transcendental irrationality and unceasing change. Until the end of the encounter, any creature who starts their turn within 3 squares of the olothec and has r<3] is dazed and slowed until the end of their next turn).

# ORCS

In a long-lost language, the word oruk-"blood fire"-described the glowing appearance of the orc people when they push themselves to their limits. While orcs know one another as kanin ("the people") in their own language, they also use "orc" with great pride, especially when dealing with other folk.

Orc history spans the world and all its ages. They've settled into villages and cities, hot and cold climates, high in the mountains and deep underground. Most orcs live in diverse humanoid societies, though a few live secluded in the tropics. Though they are no more likely to stand in the way of adventurers' than any other folk, orcs who do fill the same roles as other humanoids: mercenaries, bounty hunters, garroters, guards, cultists, and corrupt kings.

### **Relentlessly Tough**

Orcs grow to impressive heights. The veins that commonly stripe their tough-skinned faces can appear more vibrant when they're excited or driven. Their hair, which ranges from coarse to fine, extends from their heads and drapes across their shoulders like royal mantles. Strong tusks extend past their lips and guard the rest of their teeth.

Few other humanoids can match the endurance of an orc, and orcs who train for hunting and combat can rally themselves to move faster and prevail longer. Should an orc find themself on the brink of death, their veins instinctively surge with "blood fire," glowing brightly and invigorating them to perform one last attack. Blood fire often appears red, though orcs from the mountains and underground glow blue and white, respectively.

### **Innate Power**

The intense power of an orc's spirit occasionally manifests as raw magic. Orc eyes of Grole hone their magic into a singular elemental affinity for focused manipulation. Orc terranovas move their magic through their feet, surging into the earth. Orc godcallers use song to spark the magic inherent in every creature's spirit.

#### Mohlers

Mohlers are spined, pig-like animals who corkscrew through the ground as fast as they can run. Native to deserts and forests, these burrowing creatures produce shallow networks of tunnels just below the surface. Where orcs go, mohlers are sure to follow. In times of peace, orcs domesticate them to plow the earth and eat pests-and in times of war, mohlers reshape the battlefield to knock the orcs' enemies off their feet.

When an orc community has exceptional gratitude for the deeds of one of their own or an outsider, they bestow the companionship of a mohler upon the individual. Treated kindly, mohlers make steadfast companions, protecting their caregivers with their lives. If mistreated, a mohler returns to their original den, and the orcs hunt the responsible party.

### **Scyzas**

Orcs rely on giant bipedal lizards called scyzas to carry them over great distances. They adorn these mounts, which originated in the tropics, with great harnesses that allow dozens of orcs to ride a scyza at the same time. The lizards are fearless in the face of danger, making them perfect battle mounts. A scyza's trunk-like legs and claws cleave through the ground and kick up terrible dust storms. Worse still are their battering head crests, which emit a terrible, bone-shaking ringing sound.

#### Orc Languages

Most orcs speak Caelian and Kalliak.

**Orc Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any orc's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

### t **Overwhelming March 3 Malice**

Each orc shifts up to their speed, moving through enemy spaces if they can. Each enemy passed through during this movement makes a **Might test**.

- 1 6 damage; prone
- 2 4 damage; prone
- 3 Push 2

### a **Mohler Trench 5 Malice**

An orc acting this turn summons 2 **mohlers** out of the ground, who dig a trench that is a 10 x 1 line within 10 squares when they appear. The trench is 2 squares deep and is difficult terrain. The trench can't be created directly underneath creatures.

### a **Mohler Cavity 7 Malice**

The ground shakes as a group of mohlers dig a 5 cube pit beneath an area where at least one creature is on the ground. The area is difficult terrain. Each orc in the area can shift into the nearest unoccupied space outside the pit before it is completed. Each nonorc in the area makes an **Agility test**.

- 1 4 damage; the target falls; prone and can't stand (EoT)
- 2 4 damage; the target falls
- 3 The target can shift into the nearest unoccupied space outside the pit.

**Effect:** The forced movement distance is equal to the number of squares the bloodrunner moved on their turn before using this ability. An ally targeted by this ability ignores the damage and can move up to that same distance.

 Malice: An ally targeted by this ability can make a free strike after the forced movement is resolved.

### t **Unimpeded**

The bloodrunner can end their movement in a prone creature's space. The first time on a turn that a bloodrunner enters any creature's space, that creature takes 3 damage.

### t **Relentless**

If the bloodrunner is reduced to 0 Stamina, they can make a free strike before dying. If the target of the free strike is reduced to 0 Stamina, the bloodrunner is reduced to 1 Stamina instead.

# RADENWIGHTS

The ratfolk known as radenwights are blessed with coordination and acrobatics so impressive and effective that they might be a highly trained and practiced circus act. They enjoy building their warrens, known as "meddles," under cities where the chaos of daily life makes raiding the people above fun and easy.

When the radenwights' enemies expect them to scurry away like rats, they are painfully surprised to see the combined arrows, bodies, and blades of a meddle thrown against them all at once. Whatever the ratfolk do, they do it fearlessly, with deeply cherished values of bravery and fair play shining through for even the most rakish and roguish of them. Radenwights aren't above banditry if it would support the meddle, but they greatly prefer to overwhelm, knock down, and knock out their targets rather than engage in deadly violence. They prefer weapons of precision and look for opportunities to strike as they and their comrades create openings for one another.

# Bonds and Bravado

It's a big world out there for a bunch of small ratfolk, and radenwights learned long ago that trying to survive by running away or climbing to safety gets you only so far. Radenwights learn boldness from birth, and are taught to hurl themselves fearlessly against any challenge that stands in their way. The key to this bravery is the intense bond of trust that exists between every radenwight, their comrades, and their community-as well as the knowledge that every other radenwight will act just as decisively as they do. In a scrap, it's not one radenwight's blade or arrow that brings down the foe, but the instant and instinctual follow-up from their fellows.

# The Magic of Music

The pursuit of arcane studies is unusual among radenwights, though the community throws their support behind any child who happens to show that talent. Somewhat more common is the spontaneous discovery of magical aptitude through music, as the culture of radenwight meddles strongly emphasizes both music and dance. Radenwights are particularly drawn to flutes and panpipes, inspired by the legend of a flutist whose playing enraptured an evil dragon-even as others in her meddle lined up a suitably sized boulder to be dropped on the creature from the cliff above.

# The Great Maclette

The name Maclette is never uttered by radenwights without "The Great" before it. That maestro leads his band in complex city-wide robberies while always staying one step ahead of any would-be ratcatchers. Some say Maclette leads his life of crime to provide for his meddle, while others claim he strives to be king of the criminal world.

In truth, the Great Maclette finds beauty in the thrill of the heist. Robbery is as euphonious as music to his ears, and the maestro treats every operation like a new composition. As long as his band remains at large, he'll always be looking to outdo himself with his next great overture.

# Radenwight Languages

Most radenwights speak Caelian and Szetch.

### **Radenwight Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any radenwight's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

### m **Trouser Cut** 2d10 + 2 **3 Malice**

| **Magic, Melee, Ranged** | **Main action** |

t

| --- | ---:|
| **📏 Melee 1** | **🎯 One creature** |

 7 damage; push 3

 10 damage; push 3, taunted (EoT)

 13 damage; push 5, taunted (EoT)

**Effect:** If the target is wearing clothing covering the lower half of their body, they must use a maneuver once to pull that clothing up before they can move.

Special: This ability can't be used by a minion.

t **Rat Race 5 Malice** Each radenwight in the encounter shifts up to their speed. If a radenwight ends this shift adjacent to one or more radenwights, they can make a melee free strike against each enemy adjacent to them.

### a **Rally the Rodents 7 Malice**

A radenwight uses music to coordinate living rats, forming a 10 wall of rats scurrying atop one another into unoccupied spaces anywhere on the encounter map. The wall doesn't block line of effect for radenwights and their allies, but it does for other creatures as the rats coordinate their movements with the radenwights. Each square of the wall has 10 Stamina.

If the last radenwight in the encounter dies and the wall is still standing, the rats let out a hideous screech as they disperse. Each enemy on the encounter map makes an Intuition test.

- 1 7 sonic damage; the target can't take a respite activity during their next respite
- 2 5 sonic damage 3 No effect.

# RIVALS

They take the jobs you were eyeing on the local town's job board. They sit at your favorite table in the tavern with the best drinks, food, and entertainment. You know their names, and they know yours. They're rivals-heroes just like you. Maybe even better.

Rivals are NPCs built around the mechanics of seven of the classes in *[Draw Steel: Heroes](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Heroes)*-the conduit, elementalist, fury, null, shadow, tactician, and talent (see Chapter 5: Classes in that book). Their stat blocks are streamlined and modular, meant to be easy to adjust on the fly with ancestral traits or signature abilities. Examples of each type of rival are presented at every tier, capturing their foray into renown as they inevitably cross, clash with, and impede the player characters' own heroic journey.

### **Rival Stat Block List**

### **Using Rivals in a Campaign**

These grab-and-go adaptations of classes are meant to capture a class's fantasy without making Directors run a full hero character sheet. They also seamlessly work together, allowing Directors to build a party of NPC heroes or villains who can be rivals, enemies, or even allies. The next time the heroes need a bit of competition or need to quickly visit a local tavern, temple, or guild hall in search of capable adventurers to help with a quest, you won't be fumbling for a stat block. That's what rivals are for.

### **Rival Ancestries**

You can adjust any rival stat block to more closely model a player character of a specific ancestry. Choose an ancestry from the Rival Ancestries table, then modify the stat block by adding the keyword, adjusting the size, adding the stability adjustment value, and giving them the ancestral trait.

### **Rival Abilities**

Any rival can replace their signature ability with a signature ability a hero has access to. The fury, shadow, and tactician can select a signature ability from any kit (see Chapter 6: Kits in *[Draw Steel: Heroes](https://mcdm.gg/DS-Heroes)*), and other rivals can select a signature ability from their respective class. If you replace a rival's signature ability, the replacement ability deals extra damage equal to the rival's level and targets two creatures or objects if the original ability targets only one.

### **Rival Languages**

Most rivals speak Caelian and two other languages.

### **Rival Malice Level 1+ Malice Features**

At the start of any rival's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

### t **Work as One 3 Malice**

Until the end of the round, each rival can impose a bane on a strike made against an adjacent rival as a free triggered action.

### t **We Just Do It Better 3 Malice**

Until the end of the round, whenever any rival makes a power roll against the target of their Rivalry trait, they roll a d3 and add it to the power roll.

### a **Check Out Our Loot 5 Malice**

One rival pulls out a magic consumable and hurls it, targeting a 5 x 1 line within 1 square of them or a 3 cube within 10 squares of them. Each enemy in the area makes an Agility test. The rival chooses a damage type and a condition for the outcome of the test from one of the following pairs: sonic damage and dazed, poison

- **≤11:** damage and weakened, or fire damage and frightened. 11 damage; the condition affects the target (save ends)
- **12-16:** 8 damage; the condition affects the target (EoT)
- **17+:** 5 damage

### t **Calling the Shots 7 Malice**

Each rival regains 10 Stamina. Until the end of the round, whenever a rival uses an ability against an enemy, each other rival adjacent to that enemy can make a free strike against them.

### t **Coordinated Takedown 10 Malice**

Each rival moves up to their speed and uses a main action or maneuver that doesn't cost Malice.

### t **Overwhelm**

Once per turn, when the fury force moves a creature or object, or shifts adjacent to a creature or object, they can make a free strike against that creature or object.

### t **Rivalry**

At the start of an encounter, the fury chooses one creature within their line of effect. Both the fury and the creature can add a d3 roll to power rolls they make against each other.

### **Customizing Rivals**

Rival stat blocks fill out a typical party in terms of roles, but you can easily change them to represent a class that isn't presented here. For example, you can make a troubadour by using the elementalist as a starting point and making the following changes:

- ¥Make Presence their highest characteristic.
- ¥Replace their signature ability with the troubadour's Cutting Sarcasm ability (adjusting it to target two creatures and deal extra damage equal to the troubadour's level).
- ¥Replace their second main action with Quick Rewrite.
- ¥Replace their triggered action with Turnabout Is Fair Play.

You can also use the fury as a starting point for a censor by making the following changes:

- ¥Reverse their Might and Agility scores.
- ¥Replace their signature ability with the censor's Your Allies Cannot Save You ability (adjusting it to target two creatures and deal extra damage equal to the censor's level).
- ¥Replace their second main action with Behold a Shield of Faith.
- ¥Replace their trait with Lead By Example.

**Trigger:** A creature deals damage to the talent. **Effect:** The talent halves the damage and shifts up to 2 squares.

### t **Rivalry**

At the start of an encounter, the talent chooses one creature within their line of effect. Both the talent and the creature can add a d3 roll to power rolls they make against each other.

### Rivals-2nd Echelon

The rivals have learned a few new tricks since they last encountered the heroes. Rivalry is a two way street, however, and they'll be sorely disappointed if the heroes can't keep up.

**Rival Fury Level 5 Elite Brute**
- **12-16:** 16 damage; m<2] grabbed
- **17+:** 21 damage; m<3] grabbed

**Effect:** The target must be the fury's size or smaller. While the target is grabbed this way, the fury and their allies gain an edge on strikes against them.

### t **Overpower**

Once per turn, when the fury force moves a creature or object, or shifts adjacent to a creature or object, they can use a signature ability against that creature or object.

### t **Rivalry**

At the start of an encounter, the fury chooses one creature within their line of effect. Both the fury and the creature can add a d3 roll to power rolls they make against each other.

# Rivals

### **The Black Iron Pact**

A secret society created to overthrow Capital's political and cultural structure, the Black Iron Pact draws its name from Ajax's sobriquet, the Iron Saint. Iron is a metal with deep symbolism to the tyrannical saint.

The five most powerful members of the pact-the High Command formally lead the society and serve as its strike team. The identity and whereabouts of the Black Iron Pact's original founder are closely guarded secrets, known only to Ajax and the High Command.

The pact's true numbers also remain a mystery, and many citizens work for them unknowingly. Such subterfuge ensures the pact's agents can't be traced back to the High Command.

### Goals

The Black Iron Pact's primary goal is the conquest of Capital and the installation of Ajax as its ruler and god. The pact's agents are true believers of Ajax's gospel, which seeks change through force and violence. Their evil belief is that humans are the true owners of this world, and as such, only humans can join the Black Iron Pact, though the society employs nonhuman pawns when risk of capture or death is high.

### **Running the Black Iron Pact**

The Black Iron Pact is an example of a 5th-level rival party. You can use the following statblocks, modifying each rival with the human ancestry.

**Lord Erasmus Deseo:** Rival Tactician **Canon Athenodorus:** Rival Conduit **Cloak:** Rival Shadow **Lady Avalla Deseo:** Rival Elementalist **Qar, Master of Jackals:** Rival Null

Additionally, many members of the pact-notably senior member Erasmus and his wife Avalla-openly sneer at the idea of guilds (essentially scorning everyone in the middle class), and they object to anyone but a human man holding public office, owning any assets, or even learning to read.

# Rivals-3rd Echelon

Rivals at the 3rd Echelon have been through quite a few adventures the heroes might not know anything about. Even if they've clashed with the heroes a few times in the past, there's something *different* about the rivals now.

is grabbed this way, the fury and their allies have a double edge on strikes against them.

### t **Rout**

Once per turn, when the fury force moves a creature or object, or shifts adjacent to a creature or object, they can use a signature ability that gains an edge against that creature or object.

### t **Rivalry**

At the start of an encounter, the fury chooses one creature within their line of effect. Both the fury and the creature can add a d3 roll to power rolls they make against each other.

### t **Rivalry**

dealt and is pushed up to 5 squares.

At the start of an encounter, the talent chooses one creature within their line of effect. Both the talent and the creature can add a d3 roll to power rolls they make against each other.

# SHAMBLING MOUND

Rich soil squelches under every footstep. Curtains of menacing vines block the way, and muffled groans echo distantly under the darkening canopy. But by the time a hapless explorer realizes the ground is moving, it's too late-the shambling mound has devoured them.

Found in overgrown swamps, stinking marshes, dense wodes, and dark, damp rainforests, the shambling mound is a wandering mass of vegetation that feeds on everything in their path.

# Noxious Origins

A shambling mound is most often a byproduct of nearby hags or mages, especially evil ones or those utilizing green magic. Latent magic seeps into the surrounding land, coalescing into a nocuous creature consumed by hunger. The shambling mound knows only that they must grow, and that to grow they must feed-and thus they wander in search of a hunting ground.

It is believed these magical origins are what give shambling mounds their ability to produce poisons, which vary from region to region. For example, the toxins from a shambling mound along coastal beaches or swamps might appear milky white and smell sweet like manchineel trees. Meanwhile, shambling mounds found in rainforests might give off a heady, intoxicating sweet scent at night, luring victims in with beautiful pale blooms like angel's trumpets and producing intense hallucinations for those unfortunate enough to become poisoned. But while their specific effects might change, each shambling mound's toxins typically have the same aim: enervate their foes and then magically absorb that lost strength and vitality.

### **Alchemical Ingredients**

After a shambling mound dies, a creature can make a Reason test to extract toxins from the remains.

- **≤11:** The creature extracts no toxins.
- **12-16:** The creature extracts enough toxins to craft one vial of poison.
- **17+:** The creature extracts enough toxins to craft three vials of poison.

Creating poison from the extracted toxins requires the completion of a special crafting project (see Chapter 12: Downtime Projects of *Draw Steel: Heroes*).

**Item Prerequisite**: Shambling mound toxins **Project Source**: Texts or lore in Caelian **Project Roll Characteristic**: Reason or Intuition **Project Goal**: 45

As a maneuver, one vial of poison can be applied to a weapon. For 1 minute after the poison is applied, damagedealing abilities using that weapon deal an extra 4 + 1d6 poison damage.

# Hearty Eaters

As a shambling mound drags their massive form through the undergrowth, they consume any organic matter they pass. What is more satisfying, however, is when they find a shadowed, overgrown place to lurk until the meal comes to them-a veritable feast for little effort. After a mound engulfs their prey, be they animal or adventurer, the meal-to-be is sealed in a sack of interwoven vines and leaves. This vegetative hunter can then sap the strength of those within to feast or empower itself.

# Verdant Core and Expansive Sprawl

When fighting a shambling mound, most attention is drawn to the cavernous chamber that holds their consumed victims. However, the shambling mound protects a smaller magic crux at their core with a knot of vines, leaves, and other natural defenses. The mound can expose this core to free up their form and become deadlier, thus opening themselves up to more potential harm.

One must also be wary of the area around a shambling mound. Their vines reach out far, the full extent of their form hidden among other flora until they strike.

### **Shambling Mound Malice Malice Features**

At the start of a shambling mound's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

s **Poisoned Vines 3 Malice** The shambling mound seeps noxious residue from their vines. The next time they use their Vine Lash ability before the end of their next turn, they deal an extra 12 poison damage to each target.

### b **Frenzy Lash 5 Malice**

The shambling mound lashes out at each enemy within 10 squares of them, driving them back or into the air. Each target makes an **Agility** test.

- **≤11:** 7 damage; push 7 or vertical push 3; restrained (save ends)
- **12-16:** 6 damage; push 5 or vertical push 2
- **17+:** 3 damage

### d **Solo Action 5 Malice**

The shambling mound takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

### b **Leeching Wilds 7 Malice**

Until the end of the shambling mound's next turn, the area within 10 squares of them is difficult terrain for enemies, and any enemy in the area takes a bane on power rolls. Any enemy who starts their turn in the area takes 4 acid damage, and the shambling mound regains an equal amount of Stamina.

Solo Turns: The shambling mound can take two turns each round. They can't take turns consecutively.

### t **Engulfing Sack**

The shambling mound has a vegetative sack on their body where they carry engulfed creatures. The sack has 30 Stamina, damage immunity 5, and fire weakness 10.

![icon](image) Melee 6

| **m **Engulf 2 Malice** Melee** | **Main action** |
| --- | ---:|
| **📏 Melee 6** | **🎯 One creature or object** |

**Effect:** The target must be size 1L or smaller. The shambling mound reaches out with writhing vines, and if the target has a<3], they are engulfed into the shambling mound's sack. If the target is grabbed by the shambling mound, the potency increases by 1. An engulfed creature is restrained, takes 3 poison damage at the start of each turn, and can't take damage from abilities used from outside the sack. When the shambling mound moves, the engulfed creature moves with them. If the shambling mound dies or their sack is destroyed, each engulfed creature is freed and appears in an unoccupied space within 2 squares of the shambling mound.

+ Malice: The shambling mound can engulf one additional target for each 2 Malice spent.

| **s **Leech** -** | **Maneuver** |

###

# TIME RAIDERS

Genetic rebels, the space punks known as the time raiders (called the *kuran'zoi* among themselves) scour the Sea of Stars, the Sea Between Worlds, for heavily laden ships of any type. But they prefer the ships of UNISOL and other empires, for they love raiding the frigates of powerful governments who think their money and imperious nature can buy security.

# Veterans of the Psychic Wars

Thousands of years ago, the synlirii-those powerful and evil psionic horrors more commonly known as voiceless talkers-created the kuran'zoi as soldiers. But as the synlirii experimented with and enhanced these warriors' psionic potential, the kuran'zoi came to understand the true nature of their progenitors. They rebelled against the synlirii and fled to the Sea of Stars, becoming nomads of the timescape.

# Hardened-Vision Hexapods

Kuran'zoi possess resilient ocular sensors that allow them to see in the dark. Knowing these sensors would also defend them against the hardlight storms of the Astral Sea, the escaping kuran'zoi chose the Sea of Stars as their home. They thrive where the winds of limbo roar.

Time raiders also have two sets of arms, allowing them to wield melee weapons at the same time as ranged weapons. A single well-trained kuran'zoi is like a squad unto themself.

# Psi-Tech

Like their synlirii foes, time raiders travel on mindships and wield psionic weapons and tools that only their people can activate. Many kuran'zoi specialize in melee weapons that psionically devastate enemies, but time raider vertexes also learn to pilot enormous suits of psionic armor that empower their allies.

# Genre Raiders

The moniker "time raider" is a bit of a misnomer. Because they are pirates of the upper worlds, whenever a time raider hunting party arrives in Orden the locals assume these must be warriors from the future, wielding marvelous weapons of light that hit as hard as steel.

# Leave a Few Alive

Time raider pirates plunder the vessels they target, but allow just enough of the crew to survive so the ship can make it back home. Kuran'zoi pirate captains often remind their crews: "Leave the sheep alive. Next year, they'll return with a new coat of wool for us to shear."

# Creatures Outside Time

While in the Sea of Stars, time raiders and other creatures don't age. As a result, many living kuran'zoi recall the Psychic Wars. They carry the lessons learned from millennia of conflict with the synlirii into new battles with devastating effect, using mindships to launch attacks on other planes and appearing exactly where they want to. However, this knowledge serves them far beyond war. Time raiders raise their young in ruined citadels and similar strongholds on obscure worlds, keeping their creches secret and protected.

# Time Raider Languages

Most time raiders speak Caelian and Voll. Because of the number of worlds they've visited, many time raiders have their speech peppered with misplaced tenses and strange references.

### **Time Raider Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any time raider's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

### a **Gravity Well 3 Malice**

Area, Psionic, Ranged, Weapon Maneuver e 5 cube within 3 x Special

| **3 Malice**** | **Maneuver** |

![target icon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Target_icon.svg/24px-Target_icon.svg.png) Special

**Effect:** A time raider acting this turn activates a gravity well in the area. The gravity well sits at the center of the cube and lasts until the end of the encounter, or until a creature adjacent to the well uses a maneuver to deactivate it. The area is difficult terrain for enemies. Any enemy who ends their turn in the area is pulled up to 4 squares toward the well.

t **Recall Module 5 Malice** Until the end of the round, each time raider gains a +3 bonus to speed, and can teleport up to their speed as a move action.

### p **Psi-Cage 10 Malice**

All time raiders in the encounter collectively create a psionic field over the encounter map, which lasts until the first time raider with the highest Stamina maximum drops to 0 Stamina or chooses to end the field (no action required). While the field is up, each non-time raider on the map makes a Reason test against this psionic effect at the start of each round.

- **≤11:** 10 psychic damage; slowed (EoT)
- **12-16:** 7 psychic damage; slowed (EoT)
- **17+:** No effect.

**Effect:** The hijack psychically latches their sickle onto the target and closes the distance between them. If the target is larger than the hijack, the hijack moves adjacent to the target. Otherwise, the target is pulled up to 4 squares toward the hijack.

**Effect:** The tyrannis fires a sensor mine into each unoccupied square in the area, and creates a gravity well whose area contains one or more squares of the tyrannis's space (see Gravity Well). Whenever an enemy enters a square with a sensor mine in it, the mine explodes, dealing 3 damage to the enemy.

# TROLLS

Ravenous trolls rampage through the wild to quell their fathomless hunger, leaving only destruction in their wake. Tall and gangly, they have mottled green skin covered by a mane of matted hair that runs down their neck and back. In many ways, they resemble massive humanoids, but their exaggerated features belie this comparison. A troll's lower jaw hangs unhinged and distended, and their long arms end in claws that drag along the ground as they walk.

# Hypermetabolism

A troll's constant hunger and aggression beget a life of violence. Like a grotesque miracle, they quickly assimilate consumed flesh into themselves to regenerate their body. Some scholars think this extreme metabolic process is the source of their hunger, but none know for certain which came first.

# Phases of Destruction

Fortunately for the ecosystems they inhabit, trolls can't be active all the time. Their natural behavior is to hunt relentlessly for a few days, then return to their dens to rest for as much as a week. Patient troll hunters can wait for this torpor and catch their quarry by surprise-though the cost of waiting can be high thanks to the damage a troll might do in the meantime.

# Strange Mutations

Trolls prefer to prey upon humanoids and animals, but stories tell of them feeding on fetid demons and undead, assimilating those creatures' flesh to magnificent and horrifying effect. A troll with loose hanging skin, curling nails, or exposed bone might be in better health than their appearance would suggest.

# Limbjumbles

When a suitably large piece of a troll is torn off in battle, it does its very best to keep on living. Deep-seated survival instinct goes into overdrive, causing the detached piece to sprout unthinkable assortments of malformed arms and legs. Though these limbjumbles are ultimately short-lived, they can often be found tumbling awkwardly behind living trolls.

### **Mutating Your Trolls**

At the director's discretion, a troll can mutate after consuming the flesh of any creature and gain some of their damage immunities, traits, abilities, and movement options. For instance, a troll who devours the carcass of a dead draconian might grow wings and gain their signature ability!

Be aware that this can increase the difficulty category of an encounter while one or more of these mutated trolls are present-especially if their mutations enable them to deal more damage than normal or grant them an acid or fire damage immunity.

# Troll Languages

Most trolls speak High Kuric or Variac, while a few also know Caelian. Trolls are notably difficult to negotiate with unless heroes can provide more appetizing food than themselves.

### **Troll Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any troll's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

a **Foul Spew 3 Malice** One troll acting this turn spews out a half-digested meal in a 5 x 1 line within 1 square of them. Each troll in the area regains 3 Stamina. Each enemy in the area makes a **Might test**.

- **≤11:** 12 acid damage; dazed (EoT)
- **12-16:** 10 acid damage; weakened (EoT)
- **17+:** 6 acid damage

m **Emergency Meal 5 Malice** Each troll in the encounter can make a free strike against a creature adjacent to them, and regains Stamina equal to the damage dealt.

b **Bloody Banquet 7 Malice** Each winded troll in the encounter disgorges the contents of their stomach onto the ground around them, creating a 1 burst of foul vomitus that lasts until the end of the encounter. Each non-troll who enters this area for the first time in a round or starts their turn there takes 5 acid damage. Each troll in the area has a double edge on power rolls.

**Effect:** The glutton shifts up to their speed in a straight line, ignoring difficult terrain. The first time during this movement that the glutton moves through the space of a creature or object their size or smaller, that creature or object takes 10 damage, or a creature can choose to fall prone instead. If the glutton moves into a creature or object larger than them and doesn't knock the creature prone or destroy the object, the glutton's movement ends and they are dazed until the end of their next turn.

### s **Food Frenzy**

### t **Group Appetite**

The ravager dies only if their squad's Stamina pool is reduced to 0 Stamina by acid or fire damage, if they end their turn with 0 Stamina in their squad's Stamina pool, or if they take acid or fire damage while their squad's Stamina pool is at 0 Stamina

# UNDEAD

Some serve as mindless soldiers and workers under the control of a necromancer. Others rise when they die a bitter death in a place infused with cursed magic. For a few, it was a choice to become something beyond mortal. However they arose, all undead were once living creatures who now walk the land after death in defiance of the natural order.

Rotting zombies, seductive vampires, wailing wraiths, and more undead stalk the widespread horror stories nobles and commoners alike tell each another around low-burning hearths. Even the most isolated hermits know that the dead can rise, eager to kill. These popular tales fuel many people's fears of the undead. Mere rumors of a nearby ghoul pack can send an entire community into a panic. When open graves appear in the churchyard or a translucent spirit is spotted on the street, local leaders are quick to hire adventurers to deal with the threat.

### **Content Warning: Body Horror**

This section contains references to grisly body horror and viscera. To alleviate player discomfort, you can modify descriptions and abilities to be more spectral as needed.

## Dark Places

For many undead, sunlight is a nuisance that they naturally avoid. While rarely harmful to them, the sun's golden rays make them uncomfortable and shine far too bright to their dead eyes. Walking in the light of day also makes it easier for undead to be spotted by fearful mortals. Many undead avoid the sun entirely, hiding in tombs or ruins until nightfall when they can freely stalk their victims.

# Encountered Together

Undead are often encountered in groups that include more than just a single kind of creature. A necromancer might raise zombies, skeletons, and ghouls to protect their mansion, as each serves a different function as a guardian. A lich could have wraiths as messengers and soulwights as laboratory assistants. An ancient tomb might have mummies and vampires within. The undead don't need to drink, eat, sleep, or breathe, and many share an affinity for lightless places, leading to these congregations.

# Corporeal Undead

At their most innocuous, corporeal undead are a mockery of life, a body hoisted and dragged along by unnatural strings. At their worst, they are a violent scourge hungry for slaughter, and a perverse reflection of the mortal desire to exist for eternity. Ghouls, skeletons, soulwights, and zombies number among the lesser corporeal undead. Many lack a soul, and many can't think beyond the orders of their creators-unlike more powerful corporeal undead such as liches and vampires. Those who aren't controlled by others typically have a singular focus: the destruction of all living things.

The magic that animates a corpse removes the need for air, sleep, and sustenance. This magic also halts decay, preserving the undead at the stage of deterioration before they were animated. While most corporeal undead are brought to unlife by a creator, tales abound of zombies suddenly rising from graveyards during rare astronomical occurrences, skeletal soldiers emerging from mass graves on the anniversary of their death, and other seemingly spontaneous acts of necromancy.

# Spectral Undead

Umbral stalkers. Specters. Wraiths. Spectral undead come in many forms. One might be spawned by a person's vile actions in life, while another could be a soul lost to a necromancer's fell arts. Powerful undead can even manifest these shadowy beings into existence through sheer will. Regardless of how they come to be, though, all spectral undead are malice incarnate.

Spectral undead who are formed naturally from the souls of malicious, hate-filled creatures usually haunt the places where they died, while those manifested by another being typically dwell where ordered to by their creator. Left to their own devices, spectral undead stop at nothing to kill the living they encounter, with some stalking their quarry through miles of ruins or wilderness.

### **Spectral Undead and Phasing**

All spectral undead have some kind of phasing trait that enables them to move through creatures and objects at their usual speed. However, they can't end this movement inside a creature or object while in combat. Outside of combat, a spectral undead might hide themself inside a statue, painting, or other object. But when battle begins, they can't remain within or fall back to that cover to prevent being attacked.

## Undead Languages

Most undead speak (or at least understand) the languages they knew in life.

## Undead-1st Echelon

It's rare you fight a single zombie. Low-level undead most often appear in huge droves, and skeletons, ghouls, specters, and shades can overwhelm the mightiest of heroes through sheer numbers alone if those heroes aren't careful.

**Undead Malice Level 1+ Malice Features**

At the start of any undead's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

### p **Ravenous Horde 2 Malice**

At the end of this round, each hero not already adjacent to one or more undead is beset by two **rotting zombies** who burst up from the ground to appear in adjacent unoccupied spaces. Each zombie is winded. This feature can't be used two rounds in a row.

p **Paranormal Fling 3 Malice** Up to three unattended objects on the encounter map rise to float 1 square off the ground. Each object is then pulled 5 squares toward the nearest enemy within 3 squares of the object.

### a **The Grasping, the Hungry 5 Malice**

Ravenous and rotting undead arms burst forth from 9 connected squares of a vertical or horizontal surface. Any creature who ends their turn adjacent to an affected square makes an Agility test.

- **≤11:** 5 damage; restrained (save ends)
- **12-16:** 5 damage; restrained (EoT)
- **17+:** 5 damage

**Effect:** While restrained this way, a creature takes 1d6 damage at the start of each of their turns.

t **Dread March 7+ Malice** Up to four undead in the encounter move up to their speed and can make a free strike. The number of undead affected increases by 1 for each additional Malice spent on this feature. If an undead is reduced to 0 Stamina during this dread march, they don't die until the march is resolved.

**Effect:** The specter turns invisible, moves up to their speed, and is visible again.

### t **Corruptive Phasing**

The specter can move through creatures and objects at their usual speed, but can't end their turn inside a creature or object. The first time in a round that the specter moves through a creature, that creature takes 2 corruption damage. The specter doesn't take damage from being force moved into objects.

| The first time the zombie is reduced to 0 Stamina by damage that does not kill it outright, it regains 10 Stamina and rises at the start of its next turn. (This effect can only trigger once per combat.)                                                                                        |                   |                      |                                         |                         |      |

# Undead-2nd Echelon

More powerful and more self-aware forms of undead rise above the undead horde and lay claim to dark, isolated domains all their own. The longer an undead is allowed to thrive, the stronger they become.

### **Mummies**

Mummies are humanoids raised from the dead through a complex series of magical rituals. The process tethers a creature's soul to their earthly body, preventing them from crossing into true death. As part of the mummification process, a corpse is embalmed and wrapped in cloth imbued with necromantic power. Mummification is reserved for situations of grave import. A great hero might voluntarily be mummified upon death to eternally guard future generations or a holy relic. On the other hand, a great villain could be mummified to prevent them from escaping their crimes through death.

### **Vampire Spawn**

Vampirism is a curse of blood that harrows its victims, turning them into mirror-mockeries of life that nonetheless hunger for life's essence: blood. With that hunger comes power everlasting over life and death. By feeding, a vampire passes this curse onto their victims.

Though vampires are fundamentally changed from their living forms, they retain the intellect and memories of their mortal selves. A vampire's power grows as they spend time in undeath. Vampire spawn, the youngest of their ilk, are barely separated from their mortal selves. They are driven by their thirst for blood and their master's orders. Few spawn survive long enough to become true vampires.

### **Mournlings**

Powered by sorrow and rage, these hulking amalgamations of dirt or flesh defend the homes of their creators, brutally attacking intruders while sobbing uncontrollably. Mournlings express far more emotion than many other undead guardians, for their makers imbued them with sadness and loss. Though their druidic creators are long-dead, some original mournlings still defend forests, meadows, and other natural places they were built to protect.

Outside of battle, mournlings patrol for interlopers in a trance-like state. When an unknown creature creates a disturbance or approaches them, the mournling unleashes a primal cry that conveys the very essence of suffering, then bursts into violence. They continue to sob and moan even as they viciously beat their enemies to a pulp.

**Undead Malice Level 4+ Malice Features**

At the start of any level 4 or higher undead's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

- t **Prior Malice Features 2-7+ Malice** The undead activates a Malice feature available to undead of level 3 or lower.
- p **Blood Hunger 5 Malice**

One undead acting this turn uses a signature ability against a creature who is bleeding. As a free triggered action, each undead within 5 squares of the first undead moves up to their speed and can make a free strike against the same target.

**Effect:** The vampire spawn can shift 1 square, then move up to their speed. The next ability the vampire uses before the start of their next turn gains an edge.

### t **Unslakable Bloodthirst**

The vampire spawn has speed 10 while any creature within 10 squares of them is bleeding. The vampire spawn must use Exsanguinating Bite against a bleeding creature on their turn if they are able to.

# Undead-3rd Echelon

Older, taboo methods of creating devastating undead wildly vary from one another. These wretched creatures can come about by way of accursed blood rituals, terrible operations, a spirited collective resistance to death, or other unspoken methods once thought lost to time.

#### Koptourok

Koptourok is a Variac name that roughly translates to "dead tourist." It's given to those who meet their end suffocating in the depths, whether they drowned in a subterranean lake, wandered into a cave of trapped gas, or were crushed by a rockslide. These rasping, slouching undead rise from their grave desperate for the one thing they've lost: breath.

### **Haunt**

Born of mass death events that leave multiple souls stranded in agony together, a haunt is a violent collective chaos driven by a hatred for the living. A haunt lays claim to the scene of their death, which their grief forbids them from leaving so as to strand them in the mundane world. None of the souls within a haunt are necessarily malicious, and all would individually prefer to move on and find peace. But their accumulated grief drives them to tremendous anger that inspires sadistic acts of violence against the living.

### **Waxen**

When a corpse is preserved improperly, its body fat can become a substance known as corpse wax. Necromancers sometimes harvest and use this foul substance to enhance their undead minions, transforming them into waxens. These awkward, loping creatures cake their foes in foul-smelling wax to slow and sicken them. Waxen minions are often set ablaze by unscrupulous masters, sacrificing them to the flames but making them significantly more dangerous in the process.

#### Vampires and Vampire Lords

By drinking the blood of a true vampire, a vampire spawn can transcend their feral beginnings and rise to become a true vampire themself. The path of transformation is daunting, and vampires who end up starved for blood often band together for mutual protection. But with patience and cunning, a vampire can grow old and powerful enough to control vast amounts of territory and countless vassals. The term "vampire lord" thus refers not to a specific age or threshold of physical prowess, but rather to status and influence. A vampire who refers to themself as a lord invites challenges to their title and is prepared to crush all those who seek to end their reign.

### **Undead Malice Level 7+ Malice Features**

At the start of any level 7 or higher undead's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

t **Prior Malice Features 2-7+ Malice** The undead activates a Malice feature available to undead of level 6 or lower.

### p **Necrotic Rupture 5 Malice**

**5 Malic**

Until the end of the round, whenever an undead is reduced to 0 Stamina, they deal 8 corruption damage to each enemy within 3 squares of them.

**Effect:** If a target made bleeding this way is already bleeding, they are instead knocked prone and can't stand until the end of their next turn.

### t **Unslakable Bloodthirst**

The blood-starved vampire has speed 10 while any creature within 10 squares of them is bleeding. The vampire must use Feeding Frenzy against a bleeding creature on their turn if they are able to.

The first time the mournling is reduced to 0 Stamina by damage that isn't fire damage or holy damage and their body isn't destroyed, they instead have 15 Stamina and fall prone.

### t **Immutable Form**

The mournling's shape can't be changed by any external effect.

### t **Rupture**

Whenever the mournling uses the Dig maneuver to breach the surface, they make a free strike against each adjacent enemy.

**Effect:** A target knocked prone this way can't use the Stand Up maneuver on themself while any haunt is within 20 squares of them.

### t **Invisible Horror**

- **≤11:** 3 damage; i<2] prone
- **12-16:** 6 damage; i<3] prone
- **17+:** 7 damage; i<4] prone

The haunt can move through creatures and objects at their usual speed, but can't end their turn inside a creature or object. They are invisible while moving using a move action. The haunt doesn't take damage from being force moved into objects.

**Effect:** This ability gains an edge against any target grabbed by the koptourok. If one or more targets are pulled adjacent to the koptourok, the koptourok can fly until the end of the encounter.

### t **Exhale**

The first time the koptourok is made winded by damage that isn't fire damage or holy damage, each enemy within 3 squares of them takes 8 corruption damage. Any enemy who takes this damage and has m<3] is also weakened (save ends).

# Undead-4th Echelon

The deadliest of undead creatures can be placed into one of two categories: terrible machines that know only destruction, and powerful tyrants who aren't content with conquering just death.

## Bonecage

The weakness of many undead minions means that necromancers at war often find themselves shy of corpses when their forces lose more numbers than they slay. The bonecage offers a horrific solution to this problem. This hulking creature made from giants' bones is structured like a massive cage that they can cram dead and near-dead corpses into. Trawling the scenes of great battles, the bonecage fills themself with the fallen, stealing them away for ill purposes. Of course, when no mass casualty site presents itself, the bonecage is more than capable of making corpses of their own.

# Lithgekh

Every mage who lives long enough eventually contends with the fact that their knowledge will one day leave the world. For those who can't stomach this idea, seeking the immortality of the lich often becomes an irresistible temptation. But many of those who try and fail to achieve lichdom become lithgekh-a word in the First Language meaning "lich corpse." Having failed to create a proper soul vessel, a lithgekh suffers an eternal hunger for magic to sustain themself. Liches will sometimes trick or tempt mortal mages into pursuing lichdom, only to sabotage them and create a lithgekh under the lich's control. These servants are prized by liches for their ability to disrupt enemy magic and empower their own.

**Undead Malice Level 10 Malice Features**

At the start of any level 10 undead's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

t **Prior Malice Features 2-7+ Malice** The undead activates a Malice feature available to undead of level 9 or lower.

b **Death Tax 7 Malice** The undead attempts to rend the vitality of their foes. Each enemy within 5 squares of the undead makes a **Might test**.

- **≤11:** 10 corruption damage; the target loses 2 Recoveries
- **12-16:** 8 corruption damage; the target loses 1 Recovery
- **17+:** 5 corruption damage

**Effect:** A target who has fewer Recoveries than they would lose is also weakened (save ends).

Special: This ability can't be used by a minion.

### t **Bitter Bones**

If the knight is reduced to 0 Stamina, their bones collapse to fill their space with an impassable barrier. Any enemy who comes adjacent to the barrier for the first time in a round or starts their turn there takes 5 damage.

# Count Rhodar Von Glauer

After falling to a vampiric curse in his early twenties, Count Rhodar the last Lord of Glauer-ruled his tiny, heavily forested mountainous county in eastern Rhöl for three hundred years. There were worse overlords, the people said. After all, Rhodar took his pact with the people and the land seriously. He aggressively defended the villages in his demesne against constant incursions from rival counts and barons. He believed his power waxed and waned with the prosperity of the people and the vitality of the land.

Each new moon, when the Red Tax came due, the count would visit a young candidate, then emerge with renewed vitality. Across the land, folk feared their Dragon Count, but the witches of the wood wove a prophecy: "The land's darkest hour shall be the redemption of House von Glauer."

Eventually, the conquering force of Emperor Gaius VIII came for Rhodar-not because he was a vampire, but because the empire wanted his land and people. Count von Glauer was staked, and his body burned to ash. The emperor kept the Rod of Count Rhodar von Glauer as a trophy, and with this symbol of authority, he sealed his claim to the land.

Under new rule, Rhodar's people lament the absence of their lord, recalling the time before the coming of the empire as a golden age. But the witches' whispers can still be heard. For as long as the people of Glauer persist, they continue believ¬ing their Dragon Count will return in their darkest hour to deliver them from tyranny.

# Excerpt from the Chronicle of the Chain of Acheron

"In those days the Chain was in service to the Emperor Gaius VIII, third of the Five Crusading Emperors, and 27th Emperor of Caelia. Gaius continued the crusades started by his illustrious granduncle. Those were profitable days for the Chain, the Wheel, and the Gate. While the other Helltroopers waded into the deserts of Khoursir and Khemhara, we battled in the forests of Vaslor. We had it easy. I hate deserts.

"Thinking his vampiric power would save him, Count Rhodar von Glauer waited until he was fulsome in his strength before trying to extend his dark realm into Caelian territory. But we know how to deal with vampires. The black and gold standard of the von Glauer family reads, "I do the devil's work." We can attest to that. We lost many souls to that long siege, but in the end, we staked him. An old woman howled at us saying, "He is the land!" but we hear that stuff all the time. We sacked his castle, burned his forest and orchards, and delivered his staff to the emperor. That was harder than it sounds. Finger had to drop it in one of his bottomless sacks to stop the mists from coming. What the emperor will do with it, I don't know. I fear that staff may hold more than the power to make the mist."

- Dancer, Chronicler of the Chain of Acheron, Heroes 228

# A Lordly Beast

In spite of the fact that he literally preyed upon them (though only one a month!) the people of Glauer seemed to take great pride in their immortal count. Many historical sources record Von Glauer's noble bearing. He took his role as protector and defender of the people and their well-being seriously, in keeping with the traditions of classical nobility. Invited guests must be treated with decency, insults demand apology or satisfaction. Debts must be repaid, treaties honored.

Those who violated the law or threatened his people met a very different Count. It was said he stalked his enemies in the guise of a great wolf, or wing
- **12-16:** d gangrenous beast.

In his humanoid form he treated guests, even enemy commanders with honor and dignity. What his demeanor might be should he return is unknown.

# The Darkest Hour

It's been over a thousand years since The Chain of Acheron staked Von Glauer, but the wise women of Rhöl speak as though the Dragon Count is merely on vacation. Ajax killed the Earl of Rhöl during his conquest of Vasloria but has yet to dispatch anyone to rule in their stead.

For people of Glauer, the wise women's prophesy feels close. They sense the import of the times in which they live, and expect Ajax or one of his lieutenants to return to rule with an iron fist. The people speak openly now of their Dragon Count returning to defend them against this possibility.

How his return might be possible is not clear, but it would surely involve the Rod of Count Rhodar Von Glauer, currently held under the city of Capital in the Great Reliquary of the Last Emperor, also known as Ringwell.

# Count Rhodar's Languages

Rhodar speaks Caelian and Vaslorian.

### **Rhodar's Malice Malice Features**

### a **Suffocating Dark 5 Malice**

Rhodar throws one of his spears into an unoccupied space within 10 squares, or chooses one of his spears that he has already thrown.

Rhodar can see through this darkness, and any enemy is suffocating while in the darkness.

### r **The Mirror Lies 7 Malice**

Rhodar chooses two creatures or objects within 20 squares of him. The targets immediately teleport to swap places. Any enemy teleported by this feature who has i<5] is dazed until the end of their next turn.

# LICH

A lich begins life as a mortal, often a studied mage, fueled by a burning, unquenchable hunger for knowledge at any cost. Knowledge beyond life and death, beyond this world, beyond gods and fiends. Possessed by the unshakable belief that ultimate knowledge brings ultimate power. The necessary rites are forbidden in many cultures, for they require a bloody, evil act: the sacrifice of someone dear to the would-be lich.

# Forging a Soulstone

The ritual to create a lich requires a sphere constructed of something personal to the subject, such as steel from an heirloom suit of armor or a tangle of branches from the tree that shaded their wedding. To complete the rite, the subject must rip out their own heart and the heart of a living loved one, placing both inside the sphere. The hearts conjoin and transmute into a ruby that welds to the sphere, creating the new lich's soulstone. As long as their soulstone remains intact, a lich can never truly die. Most soulstones are small and easy to conceal, though a lich can construct the stone's outer sphere to be any size that suits their purpose.

# Terrifying Immortality

A lich's true appearance is ghastly. The damage to their chest never heals, and over the centuries, their body slowly decays into a skeleton. Some liches hide their appearance with an illusion that makes them even more attractive and vivacious than they were in life. Others embrace their terrifying look, proudly displaying their fell triumph to every creature they encounter.

Though all liches desire eternal life, it fails to satisfy most. Liches who were once powerful adventurers seek more of everything they've always craved-more glory, more power, more wealth. Most set about amassing all three, building armies of followers to seize whatever the lich desires from any who resist their power.

# Eldritch Lairs

Liches are strongest when surrounded by devoted followers. Although they are often encountered alone, most liches have legions of undead, mind-warped cultists, or amoral mercenary companies guarding their most important holdings. Their lairs can be found inside strongholds and castles, hidden in bank vaults or government halls, or ensconced in false temples. The most savvy of these undead mages refuse to consolidate their power in a single location, often scattering lairs in a way that leads adventurers on chases across whole worlds.

# Merciless Schemers

All liches understand the potential of do-gooder heroes to threaten their pursuits and destroy their soulstone, and they do everything in their power to stay on top of such threats. Adventurers with a trove of powerful supernatural treasures or the potential strength to resist a lich are hunted mercilessly.

Liches know they have all the time in the world to plot against their foes, and have refined hatred into an art form.

# Lich Languages

A lich speaks the languages they knew in life, and might also pick up Anjali, Proto-Ctholl, Variac, and Vastariax over their limitless lifetime.

### **Lich Malice Malice Features**

At the start of a lich's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

s **Soul Sip 3 Malice** The lich makes a free strike against one enemy within 20 squares. They then gain an edge on their next power roll.

d **Solo Action 5 Malice** The lich takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

s **Spirit Shell 5 Malice** The lich summons a swirling cloud of angry spirits to surround them until the start of the next round. Any creature who deals damage to the lich with a melee strike while the spirit shell is active makes a **Presence test**.

- **≤11:** 16 psychic damage, dazed (save ends)
- **12-16:** Dazed (save ends)
- **17+:** No effect.

p **Cloud of Deceit 7 Malice** The lich summons a mind-altering mist, turns invisible until the start of their next turn, and moves up to half their speed. Each enemy within 20 squares of the lich's starting point who has i<4] is deceived. While deceived, a creature perceives all allies and enemies as the lich, and perceives the environment as an unfamiliar wasteland corrupted by necrotic blight. If other creatures attempt to communicate with a deceived creature, that creature interprets their words as ghastly taunts in the lich's voice.

This effect lasts until an affected creature takes damage or an ally uses a main action to shake them out of it. Each time this feature is used during an encounter, the distance of the effect decreases by 5 squares (to a minimum of 5 squares) and the potency increases by 1.

**Baleful Swa**

Ranged

! **Baleful Swap 2 Malice** Ranged Triggered action 
| --- | ---:|
| **📏 Ranged 10** | **🎯 One enemy** |

**Trigger:** The lich is targeted using an ability by a creature other than the target.

**Effect:** If the target has p<4], they swap places with the lich to become the new target of the triggering ability.

### t **Herald of Oblivion**

In the lich's presence, death's call is stronger. Any winded creature within 5 squares of the lich is bleeding and can't use the Catch Breath maneuver.

### t **Glare of Undeath**

At the start of each round, the lich chooses a creature within 10 squares. If that creature has r<4], they are restrained until the end of the lich's next turn. The lich can't choose the same creature two rounds in a row.

### t **Rejuvenation**

The lich has a soulstone, which has 50 Stamina and damage immunity all except to sonic damage and holy damage. If the lich is destroyed while their soulstone is intact, their soul retreats into the soulstone. Any creature who has p<5] and who moves within 5 squares of an inhabited soulstone for the first time in a round or starts their turn there is compelled (save ends). A compelled creature must do everything in their power to move toward and touch the soulstone.

A creature who touches an inhabited soulstone makes a **Might test** that takes a bane.

- **≤11:** The creature is reduced to 0 Stamina and the lich manifests adjacent to the soulstone with full Stamina.
- **12-16:** The creature is reduced to 0 Stamina and the lich manifests adjacent to the soulstone with 300 Stamina.

# VALOK

Abandoned autonomous machines made by the ancient steel dwarves, valok can still be found deep within the crumbling ruins and underground structures of long-dead civilizations. The steel dwarves made their instruments well, though, and valok can still be activated! However, doing so without the correct control phrases could unleash an unstoppable machine overloaded by the weight of time.

### **Exotic Metal Body**

Steel dwarves unlocked the secrets of smithing valiar-the truemetal prized not only for its strength and flexibility, but for its entrancing silvery white beauty. They could turn valiar into anything, from breathtaking weapons and exquisite buildings to hypnotic gossamer fabrics that are nearly transparent and virtually indestructible. The secrets of working with the truemetal disappeared with the steel dwarves, but not before they built the nigh-invulnerable bodies of the valok.

### **Prismacore Power**

The steel dwarves also mined iridoss, commonly known as prismacore. This rare gemstone was infused with the power of other worlds. Unlike other constructs who are powered by spells or prayer, each valok's prismacore heart allows them to operate without magic. Since prismacore never loses power, valok can work ceaselessly, without rest or respite.

# Mechanized Evolution

The first valok were great machines made to dig, smelt, and build. Legends say these giant walkers could build entire cities in a matter of days, and could even construct other valok. As the steel dwarves learned the deep secrets of prismacore, they made machines who could speak and think more freely.

While two classes of valok-servok and multivok-have been discovered, ancient steel dwarf carvings hint that a highly advanced third class was created just before their makers disappeared.

## Ancient and Deep

Ruined valok litter the deepest ruins of the steel dwarves, and without the steel dwarves' secrets, their valiar and iridoss are useless to modern smiths. But some valok still labor in the depths, carrying out the orders given to them long ago and ready to end any who interfere.

### **Valok Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any valok's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

s **Repeater 3 Malice** One valok acting this turn takes an additional main action.

### p **I Was Not Commanded to Wait 5 Malice** At the end of each turn until the end of the round, one valok can either shift up to 2 squares or make a free strike.

### t **Rapid Logic Overdrive 7 Malice**

z **Malice**

Each valok in the encounter can end one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw, and can move up to their speed (making use of the bonus below). Additionally, until the end of the encounter, all valok deal an extra 5 damage on strikes and gain a +5 bonus to speed. This feature can be activated multiples times, stacking the effects.

# Servok

Servoks, the labor and siege class of valok, are huge, slow, and built for a specific purpose-though all are designed to defend themselves when threatened. No humaniform servoks have yet been discovered. Their forms depend on their purpose, but they are never smaller than a wagon. Despite each servok's utilitarian construction and the ages of grime accumulated atop their valiar, they are impressive to behold.

Servok builders once constructed buildings, roads, and walls. Some active builders still work the caverns where they were left, clearing the ground in preparation for lost grand projects known only to their progenitors. Servok miners dug the legendary tunnels of the steel dwarves. A few miners still bore deep into the earth, searching for ore and ready to destroy anything that interferes with that function.

The quaking of earth and the boom of an arcane cannon precedes the appearance of a servok war engine. Built to roll through enemy ranks with their bladed rake, the war engine can also eliminate targets from afar with a massive gun that shoots both magic blasts and burning oil. Many war engines went to battle and never returned, and where they wander now, they consider every creature they meet who isn't a steel dwarf to be an enemy.

### **Multivok**

Smaller than servoks, multivoks can speak and carry out commands, though their capacity for complexity is limited. While multivoks are humaniform, their masterfully crafted bodies lack the expression and fine articulation of humanoids. They were built to run and maintain ships and ore harvesters, survey dangerous or distant locations, guard nobles, and oversee servoks-tasks which many multivoks tirelessly attempt to continue today.

With arms ending in axe blades and repeating crossbows mounted on their shoulders, a multivok bodyguard cuts an impressive figure. Multivok bodyguards who are still active are often found watching over the bones or possessions of their long-dead charges with unfaltering loyalty.

One of the most advanced multivoks, a chief directs and coordinates other valok to get work done. Multivok chiefs were built to oversee projects in the absence of steel dwarf supervisors. Active chiefs still roam the halls of the steel dwarves, organizing their fellow constructs to protect treasures, construct buildings, dig tunnels, and destroy invaders.

# Valok Languages

Most valok communicate exclusively in Rallarian.

| **Valiar Tunneler:** The miner can burrow through stone and metal. When the miner burrows, they create a stable size 2 tunnel in their wake. |                   |                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                         |

While the miner isn't bleeding, weakened, or winded, any power roll made against them is automatically a tier 1 outcome. A critical hit still grants its additional main action.

### s **Destructive Rollout**

| **-** | **Maneuver** |
| --- | ---:|
| **📏 Self** | **🎯 Self** |

**Effect:** The war engine moves up to their speed in a straight line, automatically destroying mundane size 1 objects or walls in their path. The first time the war engine moves through a creature's space during this movement, that creature can choose to either fall prone or take 10 damage.

### a **Burning Oil 3 Malice**

- Area Maneuver e 20 x 1 line within 1 x Each enemy and object in the area
	-
- **Effect:** Each target makes an Agility test.

- **≤11:** 16 fire damage; the target is burning (save ends)
- **12-16:** 12 fire damage; the target is burning (EoT)
- **17+:** 8 fire damage

A burning creature takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of their turns. A burning object takes 1d6 fire damage at the end of each round. Additionally, the area is burning until the end of the encounter. While the area is burning, it is difficult terrain and any enemy takes 3 fire damage for each square of the area they enter.

**1 Malice**  

Free triggered action  

◎ One creature or object

**Trigger:** The target deals damage to the war engine.

- **≤11:** 8 damage; push 2
- **12-16:** 12 damage; push 5
- **17+:** 16 damage; push 8

### t **Servok Siege Machine**

The war engine ignores difficult terrain, and their abilities deal an extra 15 damage to objects.

### t **Crafted to Perfection**

The war engine's shape can't be changed by any external effect.

### t **Valiar Might**

While the war engine isn't bleeding, weakened, or winded, any power roll made against them is automatically a tier 1 outcome. A critical hit still grants its additional main action.

# VOICELESS TALKERS

Among the most powerful psions in the timescape, synlirii (*sin-LEER-ee*, singular: synliroi) are known as the "voiceless talkers" to the denizens of the World Below-and to surface dwellers unfortunate enough to encounter them. Descended from boneless aquatic cephalopods, they are alien in thought and motivation to the humanoid species they loathe. Synlirii consider the "barking ones" (their label for creatures who squeeze air through meat flaps to communicate) an abomination that must be corrected.

# Uneasy Alliances

Though synlirii and overminds are hereditary enemies, their mutual obsession with the barking ones often leads to uneasy alliances. Both synlirii and overminds employ humanoids from the World Below as agents, trading lore and technology for information on their surface foes.

# Olothec Hatred

The synlirii's visceral antipathy toward the barking ones is surpassed only by their deep enmity toward (and fear of) olothec. Ancient myths say that the olothec created both synlirii and overminds. To overminds, this is a harmless fable. But synlirii, who style themselves as the future masters of the timescape, rage against implications that their powers come from any source other than their own superior development.

# Psionic Spies

Despite their mental powers, voiceless talkers consider information their greatest weapon. They use their psionic talents to manipulate memory and perception, obscure their forms, and pass undetected among other cultures.

# Psi-Tech

Synlirii breed mollusks that secrete plastic-like substances, using them to fashion weapons and similar technology powered by psionic crystals. The voiceless talkers' handheld psionic pistols and portable psionic rifles can be activated only by their alien minds.

# Creature Engineers

Synlirii are obsessed with manipulating the natural development of other organisms. They create hulking brains, mindkillers, and other servants using a psionic technique they call the Interlace. Many synlirii experiments don't live long and aren't intended to. But the World Below is littered with unnatural creatures who escaped the voiceless talkers' Body Banks-most of them singular life forms who can't reproduce and might never die.

# Graywarper

Graywarpers are voiceless talkers who were drained of most of their psionic abilities-and free will-as punishment for insolence or incompetence. They are viewed solely as expendable tools who enhance the power of other voiceless talkers.

# Hulking Brain

The voiceless talkers have engineered pearlescent-skinned, humanoid-shaped horrors with four massive arms and a large pulsing brain in place of a head. Called thylinça by voiceless talkers and hulking brains by everyone else, these creatures serve as bodyguards and psionic batteries for their synlirii creators.

# Mindkiller

Floating clawed brains with a trailing spinal column and nerves, mindkillers serve as the voiceless talkers' pets and lackeys. These amorphous parasites can force themselves into a humanoid's body through the ear, eye, or nose, then devour the victim's central nervous system while replacing it with their own tissue. When the process is complete, the mindkiller gains all the victim's knowledge and memories and can puppet their body, becoming the perfect spy for the mindkiller's synlirii overlords.

Mindkiller whelps are a lesser form of mindkiller who can be created in a fraction of the time. While they can't inhabit bodies, their mere presence weakens their foes' mental defenses against psionics.

# Voiceless Talker Languages

Most voiceless talkers communicate telepathically using Mindspeech and speak Variac.

### **Voiceless Talker Malice Malice Features**

**Malice Features**

At the start of any voiceless talker's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

s **Guise 3 Malice** One non-minion voiceless talker projects a psionic screen over their body, preventing other creatures from treating them as an enemy until the end of the voiceless talker's next turn.

| **- r **Memory Thief** 2d10 + 3 **5 Malice** Psionic, Ranged** | **Maneuver** |
| --- | ---:|
| **📏 Ranged 5** | **🎯 One creature** |

- **≤11:** 6 psychic damage; r<1] the target can't treat their allies as allies (save ends)
- **12-16:** 10 psychic damage; r<2] the target perceives their allies as enemies (save ends)
- **17+:** 13 psychic damage; r<3] the target perceives their allies as enemies (save ends)
	- Special: This ability can't be used by a minion.

### p **Evolutionary Circuit 10 Malice**

All voiceless talkers link their minds, creating a circuit that empowers them while two or more voiceless talkers remain in the encounter. While this circuit is active, any psionic strike made by a voiceless talker deals an extra 5 damage. Additionally, when a non-minion voiceless talker takes damage, they can use a free triggered action to swap places with any voiceless talker minion on the encounter map. The minion takes the damage instead.

Psionic

| --- | ---:|
| **📏 Self** | **🎯 Self** |

**Trigger:** The whelp reduces a non-minion creature to 0 Stamina.

**Effect:** The whelp transforms into a mindkiller whose Stamina equals their squad's Stamina pool before transforming. The Stamina pool then loses the whelp's Stamina.

### t **Psionic Conductor**

Whenever a non-minion voiceless talker within 5 squares of the whelp uses a psionic ability, they can do so as if they were in the whelp's space.

# Lord Syuul

# Lord Syuul

"Yours is an interesting mind, Tyract. I wonder what it *tastes* like?"

Chief Design Architect of the living synlirii high science vessel *Waking Nightmare*, Lord Syuul (*see-YOU-ull*) scours the timescape looking for novel genetic specimens he can torture into new species. His spies, informants, and allies are always on the lookout for subjects with unique hereditary traits the Interlace might extract.

# The Extractors

Syuul's most trusted servants form his elite surgical commandos, the Extractors. Whenever his ship detects the presence of some novel or unique genetic ability, they dispatch a small team of synlirii genetic surgeons and a single scanner.

Scanners are 4-foot-tall floating glass cylinders filled with solid brain material and cerebrospinal fluid. They hover in place, scanning and cataloging every living being in the area in an instant.

The scanner identifies any creatures with valuable hereditary abilities so the Extractors can apply the Interlace, siphoning off the victim's unique abilities.

Miraculously, some subjects survive this process. Those who do find they no longer have access to whatever hereditary traits the Extractors stole.

# Mind Masters of the Timescape

Known to his servants and thralls as the Architect of Change, Syuul's research is no mere academic pursuit. He works tirelessly to build a catalog of mutations and hereditary traits. Talents, with their innate ability to turn thoughts into raw power, are his current obsession.

Lord Syuul remembers a time when his people ruled the world of Proteus, the Sea of Eternal Change, as gods. Before the time raiders rebelled, before the synlirii retreated to the World Below. While his fellow genetic architects are content to rule the Dark Under All, Syuul burns with hatred.

Hatred not just of the time raiders and the ungrateful proteans, but of every living being not under his direct control.

He no longer values his original technological marvel, the Body Banks, and so was happy to trade that obsolete invention to Ajax's wizard Mortum in exchange for more genetic material.

The Body Banks were limited. They required manually feeding specimens into the tanks. His new device allows Lord Syuul to dynamically rewrite a living being's genetic material from a distance. From *any* distance.

In his mind, everything that is not Lord Syuul is flawed. When his new device is complete, he will remake the timescape in his own image. Every living being, a formless mass of mind and flesh thinking only Syuul's thoughts.

# Lord Syuul's Languages

Lord Syuul communicates telepathically using Mindspeech and speaks Variac.

### **Lord Syuul's Malice Malice Features**

At the start of Lord Syuul's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

s **Guise 3 Malice** Lord Syuul projects a psionic screen over his body, preventing other creatures from treating him as an enemy until the end of his next turn.

### b **Do It for Me 5 Malice**

Lord Syuul psionically plunders the minds of each creature within 2 squares of him. Each such creature makes a **Reason test**.

- **≤11:** 13 psychic damage; the target uses a signature ability against a creature of Lord Syuul's choice
- **12-16:** 10 psychic damage; the target makes a free strike against a creature of Lord Syuul's choice
- **17+:** No effect.

d **Solo Action 5 Malice** Lord Syuul takes an additional main action on his turn. He can use this feature even if he is dazed.

p **Overpower 7 Malice** Lord Syuul sends out a psionic burst to completely overpower his greatest threats. He makes a Reason test (2d10 + 4).

- **≤11:** Lord Syuul has damage weakness 5.
- **12-16:** Lord Syuul has damage immunity 2.
- **17+:** Lord Syuul has damage immunity 5.

Once per round as a maneuver, Lord Syuul can repeat this test, replacing the previous Overpower effect.

Whenever an Overpower effect is active, any hero who has one or more psionic abilities can use a maneuver to push back by making a Reason test, replacing the previous Overpower effect.

- **≤11:** Lord Syuul has damage immunity 5.
- **12-16:** Lord Syuul has damage immunity 2.
- **17+:** Lord Syuul has damage weakness 5.
- The Overpower effect lasts until the end of the encounter.

# WAR DOGS

Ajax's war dogs-brutal patchwork soldiers-owe their new lives to the Iron Saint and fight for him fanatically. War dog minions are the freshest recruits, possessing minimal patchwork qualities and generally treated as disposable. Those who survive a battle are rewarded with gifts from the Body Banks. Those who don't survive become recycled back into the Body Banks to be reborn.

### **Content Warning: Brainwashing and Body Horror**

War dogs are explicitly evil soldiers built from the body parts of other humanoids. Check in with your players before running war dogs to make sure that they're okay with battling brainwashed soldiers with an appearance akin to Frankenstein's monster if he were built to be a shock trooper. If anyone is uncomfortable, modify the appearance and lore of the war dogs as you see fit.

# Withdrawn From the Body Banks

Body Bank technology stolen from the upper worlds allows for the storage, manipulation, and reuse of biological body parts, and this technology has been put to terrible use by Ajax and his followers. For the rich and powerful elite, the Body Banks serve as a source of reliable medical materials and even enhancements. For everyone else, they are a looming threat and a warning of what might happen to the disloyal. Those body parts not claimed by the upper classes are stitched, welded, and fused together to become an endless supply of twisted warriors.

# Soulless Soldiers

War dogs aren't undead. They still have minds, wills, and drives that separate them from zombies and mournlings. But one thing they share in common with the undead is the lack of a soul. Any remnants of a soul that didn't escape the shattered remains of their constituent parts are irrevocably damaged beyond repair in the process of making a war dog. War dogs are thus metaphysically unstable, incapable of higher spiritual functions such as empathy or love, and their personalities and beliefs are highly malleable. This makes them the ideal disposable soldier for a discerning tyrant.

### **War Dog Tactics**

War dogs have a heavy focus on minion frontlines backed by captains with powerful control or support abilities. Those captains' tactics reflect the replaceability of their low-ranking troops, who they throw into the fray without caution. Once a squad of minions is reduced to a few stragglers, a captain will order them into position for maximum effect and manually detonate their loyalty collars.

War dog captains are intelligent, well trained, and focused on prioritizing threats to their mission. Defensive and support units focus on tying up and slowing down high-Stamina threats while offensive units try their best to bully low-Stamina backline heroes. Unless ordered, retreat is not an option for war dogs.

### **War Dog Sample Encounters**

- ¥**Camp Patrol, 18 EV:** Eight conscripts, eight sharpshooters, one eviscerite, one crucibite
- ¥**Bodyguard Squad, 24 EV:** Eight sharpshooters, eight tetherites, two amalgamites, one phosphorite
- ¥**Scout Patrol, 34 EV:** Eight commandos, sixteen conscripts, two teletalites, two neuronites, one subcommander
- ¥**Oppressor Force, 52 EV:** Eight conscripts, eight sharpshooters, sixteen commandos, one pestilite, one neuronite, one ground commander

# Enlisted at Rebirth

From the moment they are reborn, every war dog is part of Ajax's war machine. Fresh recruits undergo inspections and tests to ensure their viability and assess their capabilities, and those who are found lacking are immediately recycled.

Those who meet the minimum requirements are sent to a brief but intense training camp, where they are drilled in basic combat, personal fitness, and unswerving loyalty. It is here that war dogs are first indoctrinated with Ajax's ideals, and any who question those ideals are immediately recycled. Those who survive this training camp are fitted with loyalty collars-unremovable neck pieces fitted with explosive fuse-iron charges-and sent on to join a legion.

# Chain of Command

Ajax leaves the management and tactical goals of individual legions to his hand-picked strategoi. Each strategos is an exceptionally talented war dog, often a veteran with dozens of upgrades and refinements, and is typically selected for their ability to think and plan. A strategos in turn appoints the most powerful and skilled war dogs in the legion to their inner council.

Below the inner council are hundreds of officers and thousands of soldiers. A single deviation from an order, no matter how rational or well considered, can get a lowly soldier sent back to the Body Banks. As such, lower-ranking war dogs rarely alter tactics or show initiative. Without an officer to command them, war dogs can easily turn into an unwieldy and stagnant force capable only of following their most recent orders.

# War Dog Languages

Most war dogs speak Caelian and one Vaslorian human language.

# War Dogs-1st Echelon

The Body Banks are filled with the remains of enemies of the state, conquered peoples, war dogs who have experienced a second death, and even scraps of monsters and animals that might prove useful. Though the creation of new war dogs is by no means an exact process, the flesh sculptors of the Body Banks take great pride in crafting a highly destructive, single-mindedly fanatical army.

The vast majority of war dogs are simple amalgams of humanoids fused, stitched, and welded together with stolen Upper World technology and forbidden alchemy. Their unnatural origin is on clear display: patchwork skin, mismatched limbs, and unsettling proportions marking them as artificial revenants.

### **War Dog Malice Level 1+ Malice Features**

At the start of any war dog's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

### s **Reconstitute 3 Malice**

One war dog acting this turn tears apart a nearby corpse of a humanoid and incorporates its body parts into their own. The war dog regains Stamina equal to 5 times their level.

**Effect:** The area is covered in sticky fire until the start of the crucibite's next turn. Any creature who enters the area for the first time in a round or starts their turn there takes 2 fire damage.

 Malice: The area becomes a 10 x 1 line, and if any ally of the crucibite is in the area when it is created, the ability deals an extra 2 damage to each target.

**Effect:** If the target has a loyalty collar, they are reduced to 0 Stamina.

### t **Loyalty Collar**

When the crucibite is reduced to 0 Stamina, their loyalty collar explodes, dealing 1d6 damage to each adjacent enemy and object.

### War Dogs-2nd Echelon

War dogs, like any soldiers, are outfitted to carry out warfare with weapons, armor, and no end of ghastly tools. But Ajax's war dog forces are no ordinary army, and they bear extraordinary equipment.

### **Shrikeguns**

The shrikegun is a new kind of weapon fit for a new kind of soldier. Each shrikegun is a rapid-firing bolt-thrower that replaces the draw of a crossbow with the compact energy of torsion springs. When loosed, a standard shrikegun throws a five-inch, iron-tipped wooden stake hard enough to reliably pierce steel plate at 50 yards. The stabilization grooves cut into the stakes create a shrill whistle when they are fired, leading to many less-disciplined armies breaking upon hearing the "shrike scream" of a loosed volley.

### **Fuse-Iron**

Some war dogs use fuse-iron weapons that emit flames or cause explosions. While the exact properties of fuse-iron depend on its specific alloy and shape, the material is known for turning physical force into heat and light. Special arrangements of fuse-iron utilize crush cavities to create concussive detonations that are incredibly powerful, if not particularly reliable. Fuse-iron is expensive, accident-prone, and almost impossible to work with in large quantities, so that fuse-iron equipment is granted only to war dog specialists.

### **Houndweapons**

Insubordinate war dogs are usually punished with a trip back to the Body Banks, but individuals who need to be made an example of are condemned to an even harsher fate: becoming a houndweapon. These living weapons are horrific blends of flesh, machine, and spirit created as powerful and terribly cruel tools of war. Only the highest-ranking and most capable war dogs can requisition houndweapons, given those living armaments' power and the time and difficulty involved in making them.

### **War Dog Malice Level 4+ Malice Features**

### War Dogs-3rd Echelon

As a war dog proves their loyalty and gains the favor of their superiors, they might be rewarded with special attention from the flesh sculptors of the Body Banks, smoothing out their construction and supplying them with higher-quality parts. War dogs who have risen through the ranks this way pride themselves on their nearly ordinary appearances.

### **Happy Accidents**

Making war dogs is more art than science, and happy little accidents can create war dogs with unusual characteristics. These war dogs are given great attention by the flesh sculptors, both to further improve the abilities of these deviants and to learn how to replicate their creation.

### **Made to Order**

War dogs are most often made by playing the odds, with each new resurrection assumed to create certain ratios of infantry, mages, specialists, and so on. However, by radically altering their creation processes and providing special materials, war dogs can be made who bear little resemblance to any humanoid, and who possess power beyond that of any typical conscript.

These monstrous war dogs are developed to fulfill specific roles and combat niches, and are often fused with inorganic materials after their rebirth as living war machines. Monstrous war dogs are uniformly respected for having been chosen for greatness, and they consider their unnatural forms a badge of honor bestowed by Ajax.

### **War Dog Malice Level 7+ Malice Features**

At the start of any level 7 or higher war dog's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

### t **Prior Malice Features 3-7 Malice**

The war dog activates a Malice feature available to war dogs of level 6 or lower.

# Draw Steel

# War Dogs

# War Dogs-4th Echelon

At the apex of the war dog command structure, a number of infamous figures are known for their brutal tactics, legendary battle prowess, and unbreakable loyalty to Ajax.

### **Castellan Hoplon**

Hoplon's scars are not from the Body Banks, but from years of combat and hard-fought sieges. A master of the harrying retreat, the holdfast, and the last stand, Hoplon is there to lead the defense wherever the fighting is most intense and the lines threaten to buckle.

### **Iron Champion Doru**

Upon the accidental creation of the Iron Champion, only the intervention of Ajax was able to stop Doru's rampage. His raw strength and untempered aggression make him a valuable combatant, but it is his mysterious regeneration that makes him a true monster on the battlefield.

### **Logostician Vesper**

A master of logistical support and a living portal network, Vesper is the emergent personality of several dozen potent psychic minds working in concert. From their position within an armored and highly mobile flesh chassis, Vesper manages supply lines and transport for the forces of the Iron Saint.

#### Soulbinder Psyche

Viewed by other war dogs as "The Goddess of the Banks," Psyche possesses a spirit that can return from the Body Banks again and again without ever losing her core self. She is a master of the connection between soul and flesh, and a talented mage besides.

### **Strategos Alkestis**

Leader of the Legion Alkestis and one of the most brilliant commanders ever to be born a war dog, Alkestis has made her legion one of the most feared of Ajax's armies. The Silver Wolf is known for her battlefield tactics and a willingness to stoop to any depths to gain an edge on her enemies.

# WEREWOLF

A wolf howls and your bowels freeze. Terror overcomes you. Sweat makes your skin slick, your senses sharpened. The moon is high but you feel hot. You're burning up. There's blood in your mouth and a corpse at your feet. Where did that come from?! That animal... that *thing* that almost clawed you to death last week... was it a wolf ? Was it *just* a wolf ?

Werewolves are shapeshifters filled with a need to rend and tear. They used to be ordinary humans, elves, polders, and the like. But when their feral compulsion takes control, their eyes turn blood red and they change into massive wolves or abominable hybrid beasts.

# **Howling Primordial Chaos**

Werewolves are swirling conductors of the Primordial Chaos. Their bodies overflow with energy, almost painfully so. They shift and expand their forms into more beastlike shapes to best contain their power. And one bite is all it takes for those ferocious forces to flow into their next host.

# **Brokered or Cursed**

The curse of the werewolf is actively sought out by terrible nobles and rulers looking to extend their power and instill fear into their people. They secure deals with devils who can tap into the Primordial Chaos and unleash their beast, usually in exchange for relinquishing their legacy after they pass.

Laypeople don't have the luxury of a legacy, nor do they have councils that can help temper a werewolf. They know full well the horror of losing oneself to the beast, and take action to rout out the threat of a werewolf among them. Fear leaves people submissive to the demands of cursed kings, yet oppressive to their own accursed kin.

# **On Wights and Weres**

The powers that created the werewolves were also harnessed and cultivated under the traditions of the stormwight fury. A werewolf's accursed rage can't overcome the stormwight's ferocity, nor can ferocity overpower rage. It's not uncommon for werewolves to subconsciously treat encounters with stormwight furies as if they were sport.

### **Shared Ferocity**

Thanks to their entwined origins, the werewolf is filled with an unbridled power when they witness someone harnessing ferocity. The Director gains 1d3 Malice the first time a creature uses an ability that costs ferocity while within the werewolf's line of effect.

# **Werewolf Languages**

Werewolves can speak any language they knew before they were cursed. A werewolf who has spent time researching their curse might also know Khamish, Anjali, or Khelt, depending on the circumstances underlying their transformation.

### d **Solo Monster**

**End Effect:** At the end of each of their turns, the werewolf can take 5 damage to end one effect on them that can be ended by a saving throw. This damage can't be reduced in any way.

**Solo Turns:** The werewolf can take two turns each round. They can't take turns consecutively.

### t **Accursed Rage**

The werewolf's ferocity is expressed through rage, and their abilities can inflict rage points on any enemy except a stormwight fury. A creature who starts their turn with 10 or more rage expends their rage. Then before taking their turn, they must shift up to their speed toward the nearest creature and make a melee free strike against them. A creature who takes damage from this free strike gains 1 rage. Accumulated rage disappears after a character finishes a respite.

### t **Shapeshifter**

The werewolf enters combat in their hybrid humanoid form. Their shape can't be changed by any external effect.

### t **Vukenstep**

The werewolf ignores difficult terrain.

d **Solo Action 5 Malice** The werewolf takes an additional main action on their turn. They can use this feature even if they are dazed.

p **Moonfall 10 Malice** Until the end of the encounter, the encounter map turns to night and the moon appears impossibly huge in the sky. The werewolf can take an additional move action or maneuver on each of their turns while they have line of effect to the moon. Any creature who ends their turn with line of effect to the moon with 1 or more rage gains 2 rage.

# WYVERNS

The sight of a wyvern perched high atop a rotting tree or lit upon the jagged peak of a shadowy mountain marks the boundary between the known lands and forest primeval. There are raw, ancient sorceries in the wilderness that imbue those lands with power and hate older than roads and carts.

Though they superficially resemble dragons, wyverns are not dragons or dragon-kin. Distant relatives of the terror lizards of Ix, wyverns sport tough, leathery skin with hues running from brown to red to black depending on their native terrain. They are solitary creatures who track their prey by following the smell of fear they create.

### **Mountain Hunters**

While on the hunt, wyverns perch on stone outcroppings and natural spires overlooking their territory. They first attack with their stinger, injecting prey with corrosive acid. If a wyvern's victim attempts to hide, the wyvern's hooked claws and fearsome teeth can tear open any crag or crevice in pursuit.

### **Acidic Aggressors**

Without front limbs to grasp their prey, wyverns prefer to keep their distance and strike with their long, stinger-tipped tails. A single sting is usually enough to kill common game outright, and even larger foes are left wracked by pain. Wyverns have no interest in drawn-out struggle, and they relentlessly sting their foes at every opportunity.

#### Protective Parents

A wyvern's infamous temper is easily provoked, particularly if their eggs or hatchlings are threatened. Many monster slayers for hire won't accept contracts to track and hunt wyverns during hatching season. Yet this season is when heroes are needed most, as mated pairs aggressively hunt anything or anyone to feed their young.

# **Communicating with Wyverns**

Wyverns are unable to speak. However, a clever hero carrying a feast of fresh meat might be able to reason with one.

### **Wyvern Malice Malice Features**

At the start of any wyvern's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

m **Simmering Anger 3 Malice** One wyvern in the encounter can make a free strike against each enemy adjacent to them.

t **Boiling Fury 5 Malice** Until the end of the round, each wyvern in the encounter has a double edge on strikes and can use their signature ability instead of a free strike when making opportunity attacks.

### p **Overflowing Rage 7 Malice**

Every wyvern's anger fills the encounter map with a thick miasma of hatred. Each enemy in the encounter makes an **Intuition test**.

- **≤11:** The target is taunted by the nearest creature or object (save ends). While the target is taunted this way, power rolls against them have a double edge.
- **12-16:** The target is taunted by the nearest creature or object (save ends).
- **17+:** No effect.

# Xorannox the Tyract

Xorannox the Tyract is an overmind. Formally known by their endonym, vaurath (plural: vaurathi), overminds plot and scheme against their chief rivals, the synlirii and the olothec, for control of the World Below.

# **Psionic Eyes**

An overmind is an enormous floating brain with a large central eye surrounded by many smaller embedded eyes. Even more alien, several psionic eyes float within inches of their head, each connected to a small brain that can manifest a unique psionic effect.

# **Intelligent Loremasters**

Like their rivals, overminds are loremasters of supreme intellect. They aren't usually wizards, but they all view the collection of knowledge and arcane sciences as the best tool for ultimate conquest. Overminds are cruel and capricious but enjoy tests of intellectual might. Their one vanity is their unshakable belief in their own intellectual superiority over all others.

# **Overmind Lairs**

Thanks to their innate flight, overminds prefer to build (or rather, have their thralls build) towers with no doors or entrances anywhere near the bottom.

# **Rivalries and Negotiations**

Unlike the synlirii and the olothec, overminds have an intense hatred of their own kind and never work together. However, overminds often enjoy diplomacy with other species, seeking to form alliances and build secret networks of agents throughout the World Below.

# **Smelly Eggs**

Overmind procreation involves one horror laying a single egg in a slime pool and leaving it behind. When another overmind later detects the distinct smell of the egg, they spray their inseminating fluid into the pool. These actions are compelled by biological necessity, a compulsion even the overminds can't ignore.

Unwitting explorers sometimes accidentally abscond with an egg. If unfertilized, its bearer is likely to attract the attention of other overminds and synlirii that use the eggs in genetic experiments to create psionic creatures. If the egg is fertilized, the explorer could find themselves becoming a newly hatched overmind's first victim.

# **Xorannox the Tyract**

Xorannox (*ZOR-ah-nocks*) rules as Lord of the White Tower, an isolated, multilevel finger of alabaster stone connecting to the World Below. He is commonly known as the Tyract, an ancient Za'hariax word that literally translates as "a king who rules with his teeth"-and the overmind indeed consumes those who displease him.

Xorannox is chief of the Grasp, a secret organization that seeks to overthrow the voiceless talkers' great empire and place Xorannox above all, first as king, then as god. The Tyract is a master strategist, always one step ahead of his enemies. Heroes may be surprised to discover their allies are members of the Grasp. When they meet Xorannox, he's delighted! He loves treating with humanoids! They have the same enemies, after all.

Unfortunately, no matter how useful or dependable a party of heroes might be, Xorannox is nearly incapable of resisting the urge to betray his allies. He assumes, as do most vaurathi, that the natural end of all alliances is betrayal. Thus when the gauntlet is thrown and his life is in danger, the only minions he can truly trust are his own six eyes.

#### Xorannox's Languages

Overminds typically speak Za'hariax. Xorannox also speaks Caelian, Hyrallic, and Voll.

### t **Psionic Barrier**

The zapper eye has damage immunity 15. When they use a main action, they lose this immunity until the end of the round.

# Dynamic Terrain

A terrain object is an element placed in an encounter that alters tactics on the battlefield, allowing the Director to better theme an encounter. Terrain objects range from hazards that provide tempting targets for forced movement, to fieldworks and siege engines that provide a locational advantage, to supernatural objects that an entire encounter can be built around.

# Terrain Object Stat Blocks

Each terrain object is set up in a stat block, but this stat block format is different than for monsters. The following sections explain what you'll find in a terrain object stat block.

### **EV**

Each dynamic terrain object has an encounter value cost, just like monsters in an encounter. Some objects, particularly environmental hazards, have a cost representing an area, such as a 10 x 10-square section of terrain. A hazard can always be smaller than that indicated size.

### **Stamina**

Terrain objects have either a fixed amount of Stamina or an amount of Stamina per square, depending on their nature and size. If an object has an amount of Stamina per square, it can be partially destroyed square by square.

#### Size

Terrain objects either have a standard size (for example, 1M) or a size noted as squares of terrain or material. If a terrain object's size is noted as squares, a creature can move through that terrain object but might trigger the object's effects. Many terrain objects sized in squares are difficult terrain, as noted in the object's size entry.

#### Direction

Some terrain objects have a defined direction indicating how they are placed, such as archer's stakes having a front side.

# **Deactivate**

Most terrain objects can be deactivated under certain circumstances. The Sabotage skill is generally applicable for tests made to deactivate mechanisms and siege engines, while traps might allow different skills to be used depending on their setup-Alchemy to deactivate a pool of flammable oil, Nature to deactivate a spiked pit trap in a forest, Magic or Psionics to deactivate a supernatural object, and so forth. Disabling a supernatural object requires a more intricate process detailed in each object's stat block.

Once a terrain object is deactivated, the Director determines what must be done to reset it and how long it takes to do so.

### **Activate**

Terrain objects typically activate when a creature enters their space or when the object is interacted with in a specific way. Unless otherwise noted, there is no limit to how often a terrain object can activate.

Some terrain objects, particularly traps and other objects that are set up by creatures, are set to activate only in response to creatures or objects of a particular size. For example, smaller creatures such as goblins and kobolds typically calibrate their traps for size 1M and larger creatures, making those traps safe for smaller creatures to pass through.

Many area terrain objects activate when a creature enters their area without shifting. If such a terrain object is difficult terrain, remember that creatures can't usually shift through difficult terrain without having a trait or feature that allows them to do so.

#### Effect

Each terrain object's effect entry defines what happens when the object is triggered.

# **Upgrades**

Some terrain objects can be upgraded to create additional effects. If a terrain object has a size in squares, the upgrade cost is paid on a squareby-square basis unless otherwise noted.

### Hidden Terrain Objects

Some terrain objects are inherently hidden or can be hidden with an upgrade. Hidden objects can be found as part of the Search for Hidden Creatures maneuver (see *Draw Steel: Heroes*). When you make an Intuition test to search for hidden creatures and objects, use the following outcomes for dealing with objects:

- 1 You find all hidden terrain objects adjacent to you.
- 2 You find all hidden terrain objects within 5 squares of you.
- 3 You find all hidden terrain objects within 10 squares of you.

### **Allied Awareness**

Some terrain objects have an Allied Awareness trait noting benefits and options available to creatures who have familiarity and training with the object. If a creature is aware of a terrain object and has sufficient time to study it, they gain the object's Allied Awareness benefits at the Director's determination.

### Environmental Hazards

Environmental hazards represent natural elements that creatures (typically creatures defending a location) have channeled, cultivated, or otherwise placed to give them an edge in an encounter.

| Angry Beehive | Level 2 Hazard Hexer<br>EV 2 |
|---------------|------------------------------|
|               |                              |

This beehive is full of angry bees who swarm and attack with little provocation.

**Stamina:** 3 **Size:** 1S

### p **Deactivate**

The beehive can't be deactivated. If it takes damage or is destroyed, the hive unleashes a swarm of bees.

### \* **Activate**

A creature enters the hive's space or an adjacent space without shifting.

**Effect:** The hive is removed from the encounter map and a swarm of bees is placed in one square of the space of the triggering creature. Any creature who starts their turn in the swarm's space takes 3 poison damage. At the start of each round, the swarm moves 1 square and its size increases by 1 square (to 2 squares by 2 squares, 3 squares by 3 squares, and so forth), preferring squares in a creature's space. After 3 rounds, the swarm dissipates.

### t **Upgrades**


**Concealed Hive (+1 EV)** The hive is hidden until the swarm is unleashed.

**Killer Bees (+2 EV)** The bees are a particularly aggressive and dangerous species. The hive triggers even if a creature shifts into or while adjacent to it, and the swarm deals 1d6 + 3 poison damage.

**Brambles Level 1 Hazard Defender** EV 1 per 10 x 10 thicket

This thicket features close-growing vines tipped with sharp thorns. **Stamina:** 3 per square **Size:** One or more squares of difficult terrain

### p **Deactivate**

Each square of brambles must be individually destroyed.

### \* **Activate**

A creature enters a square of brambles without shifting.

**Effect:** A creature takes 1 damage per square of brambles they enter.

### t **Upgrade**

**Poisonous Thorns (+1 EV)** The brambles are poisonous. Any creature who takes damage from brambles is also bleeding (save ends).

**Corrosive Pool Level 2 Hazard Hexer** EV 3 per 10 x 10 pool

This shallow pool bubbles with acid or some other corrosive liquid.

**Stamina:** 12 per square **Size:** One or more squares of difficult terrain **Immunity:** 20 to all damage except cold or fire damage

### p **Deactivate**

The pool must be completely destroyed.

### \* **Activate**

A creature or object enters the corrosive pool or starts their turn there. The liquid in the pool is also highly volatile (see **Explosive Reaction** below).

**Effect:** A creature or object takes 3 acid damage if they start their turn in the pool, and takes 3 acid damage for each square of the pool they enter.

### ! **Explosive Reaction** 2d10 + 2

Area Free triggered action 
| --- | ---:|
| **📏 3 burst** | **🎯 Each creature and object in the area** |

**Trigger:** The pool takes fire damage.

 3 fire damage; m<1] the target is burning (save ends)

 6 fire damage; m<2] the target is burning (save ends)

 9 fire damage; m<3] the target is burning (save ends) **Effect:** The liquid in the pool is consumed. This ability has a dou-

ble edge against any target in the pool. A burning creature takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of their turns. A burning object takes 1d6 fire damage at the end of each round. Any target with acid weakness takes extra damage from this ability and while burning as if the fire damage were acid damage.

### t **Allied Awareness**

Allies who have weapons are equipped with torches. Any ally can use a maneuver to throw a torch up to 5 squares and deal 1 fire damage to the pool, triggering Explosive Reaction.

### **Frozen Pond Level 1 Hazard Hexer**

EV 1 per 10 x 10 pond

A shallow, frozen patch of water features ice thick enough that it won't break, but its surface is slick and treacherous to navigate.

**Stamina:** 3 per square **Size:** One or more squares of difficult terrain **Immunity:** 5 to all damage except fire damage

### p **Deactivate**

Destroying a square of the frozen pond turns the square into shallow icy water.

### \* **Activate**

A creature or object enters a square of the frozen pond without shifting.

**Effect:** The **Slippery Surface** ability.

### ! **Slippery Surface** 2d10 + 2

Melee, Strike Free triggered action

| --- | ---:|
| **📏 Melee 0** | **🎯 The triggering creature or object** |

**Trigger:** A creature or object enters a square of the frozen pond without shifting.

- 1 Push 1 in the direction the target was moving
- 2 Push 2 in the direction the target was moving; a<1] slowed (save ends)
- 3 Push 3 in the direction the target was moving; a<2] prone and can't stand (save ends)

**Effect:** The triggering creature's movement ends, then they are force moved. If the target triggered this ability by being force moved, this ability gains an edge and any remaining forced movement distance is added to the ability's forced movement. The ability's forced movement doesn't trigger the ability again.

### t **Upgrade**

**Thin Ice (+1 EV)** The ice covering the pond is thin and the water is deeper. Whenever a creature or object enters or falls prone in a square of the frozen pond, that square is destroyed and replaced with icy water. The **Icy Water** ability replaces **Slippery Surface**.

# Power Fixtures

Power fixtures are especially potent fortifications for solo creatures and smaller strike forces. The more of these terrain objects that occupy the field of battle, the worse things get for the attacking side.

When a Director-controlled creature deals or takes damage, the Director can roll the d6 to increase the damage the creature deals or reduce the damage the creature takes by an amount equal to the roll (to a minimum of 2 damage). If multiple idols are in play, only one d6 can be applied to a single instance of damage.

### t **Mighty Fruit**

Once per round, any creature adjacent to the tree of might can take a fruit from the tree and eat it (no action required). The creature gains 10 temporary Stamina and has their Might score increased by 1 (to a maximum of 6) until the end of the encounter.

### Siege Engines

Siege engines are powerful weapons that require a team of creatures to operate and move. These weapons can scale in size from smaller field artillery to massive mechanisms that can destroy buildings.

### **Adjacent Creature Main Actions**

Rather than siege engines taking actions on their own, a creature adjacent to the siege engine can use a main action to activate a siege engine ability noted as "Main action (Adjacent creature)." In addition to their primary attack, some siege engines require an adjacent creature main action to reload them once they are used, while others have adjacent creature main actions allowing them to be moved or allowing a creature to improve the engine's distance and accuracy.

Multiple minions in a squad can activate different aspects of a siege engine using adjacent creature main actions.

A shard of the formerly dead sun god A'An incubates within your body, guiding you so that A'An can be restored to her true glory by earning one hundred disciples.

(This complication should be introduced to a campaign only with caution, and with the understanding that all the players are happy to have the party's agency affected by one of the characters roleplaying a forgotten god.)

- 2 You lose a Recovery.
- 3 You suffer no effect

# Retainers

A retainer is a type of NPC follower who fights alongside the heroes. Retainer creatures can gain levels just as heroes do, so their battlefield contributions remain relevant as the heroes grow in status and power. A lowly level 1 goblin guide can advance up to level 10 if they adventure with a heroic party for long enough!

The stat blocks in this chapter have the Retainer type next to their level and role. For example, a goblin guide is a level 1 harrier retainer. Some retainers, such as the human warrior or the time raider mind healer, are members of playable ancestries. Others, such as the minotaur gorer, are more monstrous in nature. Additionally, the rules in this chapter allow for the creation of new retainers using nearly any monster as a base creature.

A retainer is a follower of a specific hero. This hero is called the retainer's mentor, and their player controls that retainer in battle. Each player can control only one retainer at a time. If a hero ever acquires more than one retainer, all but one of those are considered to be working at the party's stronghold or performing some function at the periphery of any battle, not contributing meaningfully to its outcome.

### **Sidekicks, Not Stars**

Retainers are useful allies, but the heroes are always the stars of the show! Retainers are simply there to pitch in and make the heroes look good.

Retainers are simpler to run than heroes. They have fewer abilities and fewer resources to manage. Usually, a retainer makes one power roll per turn and then gets out of the way. But while a retainer's turn is quick, it can be tactically interesting! Besides dealing damage, a retainer's abilities often benefit their mentor or allow the mentor to do interesting things.

Because a retainer acts on their mentor's turn, they allow the heroes' side of an encounter to have two characters act in sequence without having to use any special abilities, providing a significant tactical advantage.

### **Gaining Retainers**

In many cases, heroes gain retainers as they acquire character features. For instance, a hero might gain a retainer from a title, a complication, or some other element of the game. When a player earns Renown, they might be able to choose a retainer as a new follower.

At other times, the events of the story can dictate that a retainer joins the party. When the heroes rescue a prisoner or befriend a former rival, you might decide that the NPC joins the party, becoming a retainer of one of the characters.

Any hero gaining a retainer is always at your discretion. If something in the rules grants a specific retainer, you can always substitute another retainer who works better for your campaign.

### **Retainers Leaving the Party**

A retainer doesn't need to always travel with the heroes. When they're not called on to adventure, they can remain behind at the party's stronghold or otherwise live their own life. Even when they're not present, they're still considered to be a retainer and a member of the party.

However, there might be cases when a retainer leaves the party permanently. Retainers aren't invulnerable, so they can be killed in battle. But they can leave under less extreme circumstances as well. If the events of an adventure set a retainer against their mentor, or if the retainer's story naturally comes to an end, you and the players can decide it's time for the retainer to ride off into the sunset. The characters might meet their former adventuring buddy again as a friendly NPC, though-or perhaps as a foe!

### **Retainers in Combat**

When using retainers in combat, a number of special rules should be kept in mind.

- Another Hero: A retainer counts as an additional hero of their current level for the purpose of encounter building (see Step-by-Step Encounter Building).
- Part of a Mentor's Turn: A retainer takes their turn as part of their mentor's turn. For the purpose of effects that end at the end of the retainer's turn, or any other rules elements that depend on the start or end of a creature's turn, the start and end of the mentor's turn is also the start and end of the retainer's turn.
- Hero Can't Act: If a hero can't act on their turn (because they are unconscious, for example), their player can still control the hero's retainer.
- Retainer Action Economy: On their turn, a retainer can take a move action, a maneuver, and a main action, just like a hero.

Recoveries: A retainer has 6 Recoveries.

- Death: A retainer can become dying at 0 Stamina and die at negative half their Stamina, just like a hero.
- Surges: Whenever a retainer gains surges, those surges are gained by their mentor, with the mentor and retainer sharing surges. The retainer spends surges the same way a hero can, but the extra damage granted to them by spending a surge is equal to their mentor's highest characteristic score.

### **Retainer Advancement**

A retainer doesn't earn Victories or gain XP. Instead, they usually have the same level as their mentor. When a character acquires a retainer, the retainer starts out at that mentor character's level. Thereafter, each time a mentor gains a level, all their retainers attain the same level, whether they are actively adventuring with the hero or not.

If a character somehow acquires a retainer with a level higher than their own, the retainer doesn't lose levels, but they don't gain any new levels until their mentor's level exceeds their own.

### **Advancement Features**

A retainer creature's stat block includes characteristics, a level, a role, one or more abilities including a signature ability, and other standard monster features. This stat block represents the retainer's statistics at their lowest level. The retainer's statistics improve as they gain levels, as shown on the Retainer Advancement table.

The number of levels a retainer can gain depends on their starting level. For instance, a devil defector starts at level 5, and so can gain only 5 levels before reaching level 10. If the level noted in a retainer's stat block is higher than 1, they don't gain advancement benefits for any levels up to and including their starting level. As a higher-level creature, similar bonuses are already baked into their statistics.

Retainer advancement benefits are broken out as follows:

- Characteristic Increase: At level 2, a retainer increases one of their characteristic scores by 1 (to a maximum of 2). At level 5, they increase each of their characteristic scores by 1 (to a maximum of 3), and at level 8, they increase one characteristic score by 1 (to a maximum of 4). For each single-characteristic increase, the player of the retainer's mentor chooses which characteristic to use.
- Free Strike Damage Bonus: The retainer gains a +2 damage bonus to free strikes at level 3, at level 6, and at level 9.
- Advancement Abilities: A retainer gains new abilities at levels 4, 7, and 10 (unless the retainer's starting level is that level or higher). Each retainer stat block is accompanied by retainer advancement abilities specific to that retainer. Whenever a retainer would gain a new advancement ability, instead of choosing their retainer ability, the player of their mentor can instead choose a role advancement ability that matches their role and level. (Advancement abilities for each type of creature role are detailed in the next section.)
- Stamina Bonus: At each level, a retainer gains a +9 bonus to Stamina. Signature Ability Damage Increase: A retainer's signature ability is unique in that it grows stronger as the retainer advances in level. Only the retainer's signature ability improves this way! The table features two columns for a retainer's signature ability damage bonus-one for a tier 1 power roll outcome and one for a tier 2 or tier 3 outcome. A retainer's signature ability gains a +1 damage bonus every second level for a tier 1 outcome, and every level for a tier 2 or tier 3 outcome.

### Advancement Example

A 4th-level hero convinces a goblin guide, a level 1 harrier retainer, to join the party. The goblin guide immediately jumps to level 4. For level 2, the guide increases their Agility by 1. For level 3, the guide gains a +2 damage bonus to their free strikes. For level 4, the guide chooses between the level 4 retainer advancement ability Weaving Knives or the level 4 harrier advancement ability Tackle (see below).

Additionally, for jumping from level 1 to level 4, the guide gains a +27 bonus to Stamina, giving them Stamina 48. Their signature ability gains a +2 damage bonus on a tier 1 outcome (for a total of 5 damage), and a +3 bonus on a tier 2 outcome (8 damage) or a tier 3 outcome (10 damage).

### **Encounter Abilities**

Some retainer abilities have the Encounter keyword. Once a retainer uses an encounter ability, they can't use that ability again until their mentor earns a Victory.

### **Custom Retainers**

This book includes more than a dozen retainer stat blocks with advancement information. But most creature stat blocks can be turned into retainers, provided a creature isn't a minion, a leader, or a solo. You have the final say over whether a player can choose a specific creature as a custom retainer.

To turn a creature into a custom retainer, start with the creature's stat block. Instead of the Stamina noted in the stat block, a custom retainer has 21 Stamina at level 1. Then use the Retainer Advancement table as a guide to adjusting the creature's statistics as they increase in level, including starting at higher than level 1.

If the creature's signature ability affects an area or targets more than one creature or object, the ability now only affects one target within distance. A custom retainer has no retainer advancement abilities, so they must take the role advancement ability specific to their level and role. Custom retainers can't use any abilities or effects that require Malice.

### Advancement Example

A 4th-level hero trains a striped condor griffon, a level 2 elite brute, gaining that noble creature as a retainer. The griffon starts as a level 2 retainer. They have Stamina 30 (21 for level 1 and a +9 bonus for being level 2). Because they started at level 2, they don't gain any level 2 benefits or advancement features from the Retainer Advancement table.

At level 3, the griffon gains a +2 damage bonus to their free strikes, a +9 bonus to Stamina (giving them Stamina 39), and a +1 damage bonus to their signature ability for a tier 2 or tier 3 outcome. At level 4, the griffon gains the level 4 brute ability Big Windup (see Big Windup), another + 9 bonus to Stamina (for Stamina 48), and a +1 damage bonus to their signature ability for all tier outcomes. This gives them a total damage bonus to their signature ability of +1 for tier 1 outcomes and +2 for tier 2 and tier 3 outcomes.

### **Role Advancement Abilities**

When a retainer reaches level 4, 7, or 10, they can gain one of the following abilities based on their role, rather than gaining the retainer advancement ability presented alongside their stat block. A retainer qualifies only for the role advancement ability that matches their role and level.

If a role advancement ability has the Magic or Psionic keyword, a retainer can swap the Magic keyword for Psionic or vice versa. They can also lose the keyword if they can achieve the ability's effects through gadgetry, martial prowess, or other nonsupernatural means.

- **≤11:** 2 corruption damage; the target is cursed (EoT)
- **12-16:** 5 corruption damage; the target is cursed (EoT)
- **17+:** 7 corruption damage; the target is cursed (EoT)

**Effect:** While the target is cursed this way, whenever they make a strike that targets only one creature, the retainer can use a free triggered action to choose a second target for the strike within its distance.

### **Level 7 Role Advancement Ability**

- **12-16:** 9 damage; M < AVERAGE slowed (save ends)
- **17+:** 12 damage; M < STRONG slowed (save ends)

**Effect:** While the target is slowed this way, if they end their turn without moving on that turn, they are no longer slowed and are restrained (save ends).

- **17+:** 16 damage; if the target has M < STRONG they are mazed (save ends)

**Effect:** While mazed, the target is dazed. Additionally, at the end of each of the mazed target's turns, the retainer can cause the target to move up to their speed in a straight line in a direction of the retainer's choice. This is not forced movement, and the movement ends if it would cause the target to enter difficult or damaging terrain.

######## Level 4 Retainer Advancement Ability

| **Image: exclamation mark in a square Shield Block**<br>Ranged | **Encounter**<br>Triggered action |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|

Ranged Triggered action 
| --- | ---:|
| **📏 Ranged 5** | **🎯 The shieldbearer's mentor** |

**Trigger:** The mentor takes damage from a strike while within distance.

**Effect:** The shieldbearer blocks the strike (if adjacent to the mentor) or throws their shield into the mentor's space. The triggering strike's damage is halved and the potency of any potency effects is reduced by 1. If the shieldbearer threw their shield, it bounces back to their hand.

######## Level 7 Retainer Advancement Ability

### m **Living Backpack**

- Melee 1

| **Melee** | **Main action** |
| --- | ---:|
| **📏 Melee 1** | **🎯 The shieldbearer's mentor** |

**Effect:** The shieldbearer straps their shield on their back and climbs onto their mentor's back, entering the mentor's space. While the shieldbearer is on their mentor's back, each of them gains 10 temporary Stamina and can use Shield Block as a triggered action targeting an ally instead of the shieldbearer's mentor. Additionally, the shieldbearer moves with the mentor, and they can't use main actions, maneuvers, or move actions except to end this effect as a maneuver. The effect also ends if the shieldbearer is force moved away from their mentor or knocked prone. If the shieldbearer is still in their mentor's space when the effect ends, they move into an adjacent unoccupied space of their choice.

They can't take main actions, maneuvers, or move actions, except to use this ability to leave their mentor's space and appear in an adjacent space.
