# Bugbears

Bugbears are the bu'gath in the Khelt language, or "the bearers of the great fear." Modern bugbears come from early goblins who first stepped into the wode centuries ago. Fey magic twisted their bodies, making them grow imposingly tall and hairy while removing all sound from their footsteps.

Many bugbears become legendary hunters and mercenaries. Many more become reclusive and hide their whole lives in the shadows. A rare few dive into their magic potential and become living nightmares who haunt the wode.

### Thrown Into the Fray

Bugbears seldom seek the settlements of others for trade or allyship, and are known to tenaciously defend their own homes or their neighbors' homes. This has given them a reputation of being covert, insurgent warriors, when in reality, bugbears simply fight to maintain their quiet solitude.

When bugbears are compelled to take action, they take to the high ground and use their powerful arms to throw anything they can down at the problem. This includes daggers, heavy iron balls, each other, and sometimes throwing the enemy at the enemy.

### Goblin Bond

Bugbears value their shared origin with goblins and hobgoblins despite the three lines branching apart so dramatically. They think of themselves as goblinoids first and humanoids second, with that relationship providing a sense of common ground when cloistered bugbears come out of isolation.

######### Bugbear Malice

At the start of any bugbear's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

> ⭐️ **Goblin Malice Features (3-7 Malice)** 
> 
> The bugbear activates a Malice Feature available to goblins.

> 👤 **Grab Iron Ball (3+ Malice)**
> 
> For every 3 Malice spent, one non-minion bugbear acting this turn grabs an iron ball and can use a maneuver to throw it at a creature within 5 squares of them. The creature takes damage equal to 8 - the number of squares the iron ball was thrown, and if they have M < 1, they are slowed (save ends).

> 👤 **Grab Javelin (5+ Malice)** 
> 
> For every 5 Malice spent, one non-minion bugbear acting this turn grabs a javelin and can use a maneuver to throw it at a creature within 5 squares of them. The creature takes damage equal to 12 - the number of squares the javelin was thrown, and if they have M < 1, they are bleeding (save ends). While a creature is bleeding this way, any ally of the bugbear within 2 squares of them can use a free maneuver to pull the bleeding creature up to 2 squares.

> 🌀 **Show Them the Great Fear (10 Malice)**
> 
> A bugbear infuses the encounter map with bu'gathic magic. Until the end of the encounter, all bugbears and allies have their speed doubled and can automatically climb at full speed while moving. Additionally, if the target of any bugbear or ally's strike has I < 1, the target is also frightened (save ends) and must move their speed in a straight line away from the creature who made the strike.

### Bu'gathic Magic

Most bugbears have some control over their inherent magic, enabling them to perform a trick or two. Dedicated bugbear channelers have learned to evoke powerful shadow and rot magic. These mages can reshape the appearance of the world around them and temporarily alter their foes as defensive tactics, providing ample warning to enemies that they are capable of far worse if those enemies push onward. Bu'gathic magic also enables bugbears to hide their settlements behind shadowy veils within canyons and impenetrable swamplands.

### Bugbear Languages

Most bugbears speak Caelian, Khelt, and Szetch.
