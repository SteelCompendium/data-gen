## Dwarves

Possessed of a strength that belies their size, dwarves have flesh infused with stone-a silico-organic hybrid that makes them physically denser than humans or elves. They enjoy a reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings, the long-extinct steel dwarves.

They are the children of the Elder God Ord. A common phrase among the dwarves is "Ord made the world." Their way of saying, "What will be, will be." Dwarves take great pride in knowing that along with Aan, Eth, and Kul, their god created the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see the world and seek glory in Ord's name.

### Tools of the Trade

Those raised within dwarven enclaves have a relationship with technology not found in many other places on Orden. The gifts of the steel dwarves are many in number, but the most prominent is that of pneumatic steam power.

Dwarves have incorporated steam into much of their warfare and weaponry, making them deadly opponents. But like all technology, it's a double-headed hammer. As much as they use steam for destruction, construction is where it truly shines. Creating the formidable and brutalist facades common to dwarven architecture is made much easier with the use of tools designed to utilize pneumatic power. Some of the larger and more metropolitan dwarven cities are rumored to power wealthier districts using steam from geothermal vents.

### Innovative Operation

The dwarves have yet to crack all the secrets of the valok, the autonomous machines that were their ancestors' greatest achievement, but they've made great strides in researching them. They've innovated ways to repurpose, recycle, and reverse engineer (to a limited degree) valok assemblage, giving rise to a new multifaceted occupation: the operator.

Operators now span the world and come from all walks of life, but the first among them were dwarves who built powered suits from excavated valok parts. These suits were initially used for construction and utility purposes, but can be repurposed and refitted for warfare when the need arises.

Word of these wonderous dwarven creations quickly spread among the tunnels of the underground, and up into the overworld. This led to a brief arms race where artisans, craftspeople, and smiths from all over were commissioned by wealthy rulers and aristocrats to create mechanized suits to bolster their armies and personal guard.

### The Press-Gangs of Kal Kalavar

Before Ajax came to power, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar were renowned for their disciplined constabulary. The constables were kind, kept order, and kept the city safe.

But now, the dwarves of Kal Kalavar have submitted to Ajax's rule and pay him tribute in prisoners. Ajax has need of bodies, to be used as either forced labor or as fodder for the Body Banks, whether to make war dogs or grant eternal life to those in Ajax's favor. Most dwarves don't like this deal, but the press-gangs are committed to their work.

The marauder lords who lead the press-gangs make use of salvaged valok communication arrays that they wear like a mohawk on their heads. The array gives them access to magnetomancy, allowing them to shape and levitate metal, including wielding multiple axes in battle.

### Servitor War Walkers

The war walker is a common sight in both dwarven armies and dwarven cities. They vary widely in appearance and make, ranging from cobbled-together heaps of belts, gears, and plates to elegant and sleek marvels of dwarven engineering. In battle, war walkers carry multiple dwarves and keep foes at a distance. In society, they're used for public transit and accessibility needs within dwarven cities.

### Stone Whisperers

Some dwarves are born with an innate talent to communicate with stone. Young dwarves identified with this gift are taken to a secretive enclave where they are trained to manipulate the movement and shape of stones using only whispers. The stone whispering technique is a deadly and quiet force in battle, and often the rumble of stone is the only precursor to an enemy's crushing defeat.

Legends speak of stone singers, dwarves who could move mountains with their song. However, those same legends tell a tale of two stone singers who harmonized their voices and nearly ended the world. This is why today's stone whisperers stay quiet, afraid of their own potential.

### Dwarf Languages

Most dwarves speak Caelian and Zaliac.

######### Dwarf Malice 

At the start of any dwarf's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

> 👤 **Breaching Charge (3 Malice)** 
> 
> A dwarf can destroy one adjacent object or square of wall for each 3 Malice spent. Each enemy adjacent to the destroyed object or square takes the object's Stamina in damage (3 for wood, 6 for stone, or 9 for metal).

> ⭐️ **Rappelling Barrage (5 Malice)** 
> 
> Each dwarf acting this turn can automatically climb at full speed while moving. At any point during this movement, they can make a free strike.

🔳 **Snaring Line 7 Malice** 

| **Area, Magic, Ranged**      |               **Main action** |

**Effect:** Each target makes an **Agility test**.

- **≤11:** 8 damage; restrained (EoT)
- **12-16:** 6 damage; slowed (EoT)

**Special:** This ability can't be used by a minion.
