## Demons

Creatures of incarnate hate, demons spawn naturally in the Abyssal Wasteland. They crave violence and suffering the way other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear lesser demons apart for fun.

The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another has a humanoid arm growing from their forehead.

### Mortal Alliances

Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.

### Soul Reavers

Demons feast not on food or liquids, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while a demon is starved for souls, they can scarcely think. Whenever a demon kills a creature who has a soul, they consume that soul and keep its energy within their body. A demon can then burn that soul energy to enact their most devastating abilities.

### Lethe

When a demon's soul energy begins to flag, they fall into a state known as lethe-a violent hunger wherein they can only lash out in a desperate search for sustenance. Demons who have fallen into lethe become single-minded and violent, seeking only to consume.

### Demonic Hierarchy

Mortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, each increasingly more powerful. Though demons don't use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service.

Each time a demon consumes a soul, there's a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. The evolution from one category to the next can be instantaneous, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt-or heroic.

### Demon Languages

Lower categories of demons speak Proto-Ctholl. As demons evolve and reach category 3 or higher, their speech turns into proper Tholl.

### Demons-1st Echelon

A number of lesser demons have been identified across categories 1 to 3.

**Pitlings** resemble rodents or insects with gleaming green eyes and terrible body odor, and disgorge a viscous, toxic phlegm.

**Ensnarers** are the result of pitlings getting hold of an unfortunate soul. A pitling in the process of digesting the soul of a creature has that soul physically bore through their head to become a fanged appendage. Mouths form across the creature's body, each attacking with long, barbed tongues.

**Frenzieds** are similar to ensnarers, but their transformation into a true demon is more advanced. This results in a fast and vicious creature full of energy and hungry for more souls.

**Bendraks** (BEN-drax) appear as an amalgamation of flesh and the shards of broken mirrors, which they use to distract and confuse their foes. A bendrak can divert an enemy's attack to another enemy, and can hide themselves or allies behind dazzling reflections.

**Mucerons** (MIU-sur-onz) are the result of an ensnarer going through repeated demon evolutions to become a brutish creature. They are covered in multiple mouths that shoot out barbed tongues, tearing at enemies as they are dragged out of position.

**Remasches** (REE-mash-iz) have physical forms blended with the nature of the wastes where they dwell. A remasch teleports around the battlefield, inflicting chaos on their enemies directly or through the minions they control. These demons are rumored to be the initial source of the teachings of all shadows through the College of Black Ash.

**Ruinants** (rew-in-ANSE) are possessed of glowing eyes and tendrilringed maws, their bodies covered in inflamed scars and their breath coming as a sickening wheeze. A ruinant can inflict fresh wounds and burns on their victims in a pattern mirroring those on the demon's own body.

**Torlases** (TORR-lahs-iz) are piecemeal abominations whose physical forms don't obey the mundane laws of geometry. They control the battlefield by using living flesh and whipping allies and enemies alike into advantageous position.

**Chorogaunts** (cor-roh-GAWNTS) are terrifying demon leaders. Each is an amalgamation of several demon bodies formed into a mobile musical instrument. Several heads are arranged into a chorus embedded in the demon's chest, and their ribs are upturned into a fleshy pipe organ. Their attacks entrance and confuse enemies, making them more vulnerable to other demons.

######### Demon Malice (Level 1+ Malice Features)

At the start of any demon's turn, you can spend Malice to activate one of the following features.

> ⭐️ **Soulburn (3 Malice)**
> 
> Each demon acting this turn has a double edge on abilities.

> 🌀 **Abyssal Evolution (7 Malice)**
> 
> A demon minion of your choice transforms into a non-minion horde demon of the same level.

> 🔳 **Abyssal Rift (7 Malice)**
> 
> Two size 2 rifts to the Abyssal Wasteland appear at locations of your choice. Any demon can use an abyssal rift as a portal to another abyssal rift in the encounter, moving into any space in one rift and appearing immediately in any unoccupied space in the other rift. A non-demon who enters a rift for the first time in a round or starts their turn there takes corruption damage equal to the level of the highest-level demon on the encounter map. An abyssal rift is an immovable object that has 25 Stamina, damage immunity 2, and holy weakness 5. The rift closes when there are no demons remaining on the encounter map. Additionally, a creature who has the Magic or Psionics skill can make a Reason test or Intuition test as a maneuver while adjacent to a rift to destabilize and close it.
> 
> - **≤11:** The rift remains open and regains 5 Stamina.
> - **12-16:** The rift remains open.
> - **17+:** The rift closes.
