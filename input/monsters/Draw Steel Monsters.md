# Monster Basics

> **For the Director**
> 
> The information in *Draw Steel: Monsters* is intended for the Director's use, and all references to "you" in this book refer to the Director. All players are welcome to read this book, but we recommend stopping short of reading the monster stat blocks. Those are for the Director's eyes only.

### The Purpose of Monsters

In *Draw Steel*, heroes face monsters. Each goblin, human, or zombie the characters encounter has the potential to become a monster who must be overcome. This book provides you, the Director, with tools to use in these moments, as well as opportunities to explore who these creatures are before and after they and the heroes come to blows.

#### Every Goblin Has a Story

In *Draw Steel*, the relationship between hero and monster is a contextual one. Before and after conflict, a monster is another character in the story. Their status doesn't rely on whether a creature who regularly acts as a hero is nearby.

**Therefore, a monster stat block represents a moment in time.** It's an imperfect translation of a creature while they act as an enemy in opposition to one or more heroes. While the players of the heroes get to keep track of a character sheet for the entirety of the game, you use a monster's stat block solely while running combat. Trying to have that stat block provide every detail about each creature who might engage the heroes in some way can and will slow the game down.

The game asks you and the other players to imagine these creatures more complexly than simply noting the damage they deal to each other. Heroes have access to abilities, skills, and motivations that don't involve fighting monsters, and the same is true for all creatures. Most creatures in this book have a language, a culture, and a multifaceted relationship to the world in which they exist. They might share the same careers, upbringings, and complications as the heroes. They can even become allies to the heroes, adventuring alongside them as retainers or in competition with them as rivals.

You can utilize your own character sheets that detail important creatures' motivations, skills, and features in addition to the combat-focused features of a stat block. This can be a useful reference for playing a foe consistently across the tests and negotiations that are also part of an adventure, especially for enduring villains.

#### When Creatures Become Monsters

The defining feature of a monster is that they impose their will on the world at the expense of someone else. A monster might take control of the land, summon a terrible force to destroy nature or settlements, or simply bring harm to someone weaker than them. This means that a creature driven by instinct who hunts for food isn't a monster unless they hunt outside their needs or their territory. Without malice or cruel ambitions that can be opposed, such creatures are no different from a force of nature.

#### A creature becomes a monster when their malice meets opposition.

This often boils down to the monster fighting the hero over the fate of someone else. The game utilizes each monster in a way that challenges the heroes and their players, inviting the heroes to use their abilities to overcome the monster's will.

#### When Monsters Become Villains

If a creature is *always* a monster, then they are a villain. Every aspect of a villain's values and worldview is imposed upon someone else, to the point where a villain's very existence is always in direct opposition to one or more heroes.

Villains typically have personal relationships to heroes that other monsters don't. There are universal or moral reasons for heroes and monsters to come to blows with one another, such as "Hurting people is wrong" or "That doesn't belong to you." But only a villain can take something important from a hero, stand for everything they oppose, or act as a corrupted reflection of them in a way that leaves the world worse off.

Usually, the struggle against a villain lasts much longer than a single fight. It's not enough to oppose a villain with intent, magic, and strength of arms. A hero also needs justice! The villain's will needs to be deconstructed and proven wrong before they are defeated, in a way that is cathartic to the hero and satisfying for all players.

As said above, a stat block represents a creature in battle. If a villain is reduced to 0 Stamina in combat but their main conflict with the heroes is not resolved, then they have lost the battle but not the war. They can make their retreat, lick their wounds, and try again later. Or if death is inevitable and their will is strong enough, a villain might return to haunt the heroes as an undead until one side finally prevails.

#### Coming to the Table

Everyone who plays *Draw Steel* will have a different take on monsters based on their own experience. In the real world, "monster" has come to mean "the other," or that which is not us. The monster is an unknowable threat until it is either known or is no more. Often, "monster" describes ferocious beasts that can't be prevented from doing us harm. Horrifyingly more often, "monster" is used as a label for groups of people and whole cultures, usually as a means of denying their humanity.

Meanwhile in games, "monster" is a clinical term for an opposing force. The monster is the away team. The word describes game actors who challenge the characters' capability to achieve their goals. The monster has traits and abilities that the characters must overcome using their own traits and abilities. The monster provides the reason for the characters to have those traits and abilities in the first place.

It's worthwhile to discuss with your players how each of them would like to engage with *Draw Steel* ahead of embarking on a new adventure. After all, their heroes will inevitably face monsters, and conflict in the game should be more interesting than disagreements around it.

#### Everyone Loves Zombies

For certain groups of players, imagining monsters beyond their game definition isn't fun. For others, building a morally ambiguous story around facing off against foes very much like their characters requires too much effort to be satisfying. Thankfully, *Draw Steel* comes with an assortment of undead, demons, and war dogs that can be fought with impunity. There will always be a need for heroes to rise up and protect innocent people from these sorts of programmed, irredeemable monsters, and doing so is no less heroic than overcoming a complex monster.

### Monster Basics

To use this book, you'll also want to be familiar with the information found in *Draw Steel: Heroes*. If you read that book first, most of the information presented in the creature stat blocks in this book is self-explanatory, and follows the setup of the player characters' traits and abilities in many ways. However, a few differences are worth noting.

#### Languages

If a creature knows at least one language, a "Languages" entry in their lore indicates which languages they know. Creatures who don't know any languages don't have this entry.

#### Keywords

Each stat block has one or more creature keywords. These keywords don't necessarily mean anything on their own, but special rules might apply to them. For instance, a creature with the Goblin keyword benefits from and can contribute to goblin Malice features. (See Malice later in this introduction for information.)

##### General Keywords

While many keywords are specific to a group of creatures, such as Gnoll or Human, other keywords are found across different monster groups.

###### Abyssal

Creatures with the Abyssal keyword, such as demons and gnolls, can trace their origins back to the Abyssal Wasteland-a chaotic manifold whose denizens hunger for the souls of mortals.

###### Accursed

Accursed creatures, such as medusas and werewolves, are under the effect of powerful supernatural curses that change their essential nature.

###### Animal

The Animal keyword is an easy one! It covers bears, wolves, and really big spiders! Aside from the animals of the real world, fantasy creatures with a similar level of sapience and who are part of the natural world have the Animal keyword. Animals have only natural defenses.

###### Beast

Creatures with the Beast keyword have animal-level sapience, but also possess supernatural abilities or traits. Basilisks and chimeras are examples of beasts. They don't have a society, but one has eye beams that can turn you into a statue, while the other has three heads-each belonging to a different species and one of which breathes fire!

###### Construct

Construct creatures, such as the ashen hoarder and valok, are manufactured, with magic or psionics playing a role in giving them life. A construct's level of sapience is determined by the will and skill of their creator. Some function entirely on their own, while others serve as mindless drones who take action only if given orders. Unless otherwise noted, constructs don't need to eat, drink water, sleep, or breathe to survive.

###### Dragon

Dragons, the giant reptilian creatures with breath weapons, wings, claws, and jaws, aren't the only creatures who take the Dragon keyword. Creatures related to dragons, such as draconians, also have this keyword.

###### Elemental

If a creature can trace their origin back to Quintessence, the Manifold of Elements, they have the Elemental keyword. This includes creatures of raw elemental power, such as the crux of fire, and creatures who merely trace some part of their origin back to Quintessence, such as meteor dragons.

###### Fey

Fey creatures can trace their origin back to Arcadia, a manifold of nature and magic that is the place of origin of all elves. Creatures from this plane often have an innate connection to nature, magic, or both.

###### Giant

Creatures with the Giant keyword include ogres and trolls, as well as fire giants, frost giants, hill giants, and stone giants. Giants have similar body shapes to humanoids, but they're much larger. Despite that similar appearance, these creatures have no relation to most humanoids (other than the mighty hakaan).

###### Horror

Horror creatures, including overminds and voiceless talkers, are creatures who appear unnatural on most worlds, particularly Orden. Everything about them is alien, and most have potent psionic abilities.

###### Humanoid

Humanoid creatures, such as dwarves and time raiders, are size 1 creatures who have similar limb arrangements to and sapience on par with humans. Humanoids often gather in communities and form societies to survive and prosper.

###### Infernal

Infernal creatures, such as devils and hobgoblins, can trace their origins back to the Seven Cities of Hell-an ordered manifold where the natives make plans to tempt mortals into contracts for their souls.

###### Ooze

Ooze creatures, such as the gummy brick, are semisolid masses of moisture and malice who take shape in dark, damp environments. Their forms range from loosely congealed puddles to more hardened and calcified shapes.

###### Plant

Plant creatures, such as the shambling mound, are made of vegetation. Like other creatures (and unlike plant objects), they can move and interact with their environment.

###### Swarm

Swarm creatures are actually more than one creature! When a whole bunch of creatures get together, whether a swarm of spiders or a swarm of minotaurs, they move and act together as if they were one creature.

###### Undead

Undead creatures, such as ghosts and zombies, are the reanimated flesh and spirits of once-living creatures who have died. Their level of sapience is determined by the creator or effect that brought them back from the dead. Some undead function entirely on their own, while others mindlessly seek to harm the living if given no other instructions. Unless otherwise noted, undead don't need to eat, drink water, sleep, or breathe to survive.
