# ETL Readme

This is a mess, ill clean it up one day...

## Plan for final PDF

1. Convert with marker
2. Work in chunks (chapters?) to get markdown fully cleaned up 
3. Publish final chunks as they are completed to the site
4. When markdown is fully converted and clean, run ETL E2E for sections, etc
5. Move to monster book
