# Regeneration

*Your transformative abilities bring you back into the fight.*

| **Keywords:** Melee | **Type:** Triggered |
| :------------------ | :------------------ |
| **Distance:** Self  | **Target:** Self    |

**Trigger:** You lose Stamina and are not dying.

**Effect:** After damage is resolved, if your rage is high enough, you can enter your animal or hybrid form as a free triggered action. If you can’t gain the temporary Stamina from that form because you have already done so this encounter, you gain temporary Stamina equal to your Might.

**Spend 1 Rage:** If you are not dying, you can spend a Recovery.
