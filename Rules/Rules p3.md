# WHAT IS THIS GAME?

This is a game about fighting monsters. About larger-than-life, extraordinary heroes plunging into battle against terrifying, monstrous enemies.

That covers a lot! So let’s get specific and talk about what this game is, and what it is not.

This game will absolutely feature dungeons. Ancient underground complexes filled with ravenous undead or creeping oozes. But it isn’t a dungeon crawler. It’s not about “clearing rooms.” It’s not a survival horror game where you must track light and food and the weight of every object you carry.

You can fight monsters in a dungeon, but the game is not about dungeons. Lots of games focus on that gameplay and do it really well! Like *Shadowdark*.

It’s not a wilderness exploration game, aka a hex crawl. It’s not about surviving in extreme weather, getting lost, or trying to navigate your way back to safety.

You can fight monsters in the wilderness, even run a whole campaign in the wilderness, but this game is not about the wilderness. We love games that focus on that fantasy, like *Forbidden Lands*.

You can run adventures with horror themes, but this is not a horror roleplaying game like *Call of Cthulhu*. Your sessions can and will feature comedy, but this isn’t a comedy RPG like *Paranoia*.

We genuinely love all those games. But we love them because they focus on specific genres of gameplay and deliver on them really well.

Our game is heroic fantasy. That’s its genre. Extraordinary people fighting dragons and necromancers.

But “heroic fantasy” is still a little too broad for our purposes, so we added two other keywords to explain how our game might be different from other games in this genre: *tactical* and *cinematic*.

These terms are just guidelines. A vibe. But we find them useful when trying to choose between different features. “Both of these ideas are cool, but which is the most cinematic? The most heroic?”

So let’s talk about what we mean when we use these terms.

## TACTICAL

Strategy is: “What are we trying to do?” Break a siege, free a prisoner, rescue a captive, steal a tome of ancient lore. Strategy is about long-term goals.

Tactics is about: “How are we going to do that?” We’re going to … surround them! Sneak around them! Pick them off one by one! Kill their leader first. Kill their priest first! “No resurrections!”

In a tactical game, positioning matters. So our game is played on a grid. Effects and distances are measured in squares. This means everyone is looking at the same problem, and there is no ambiguity regarding where the heroes and villains are in relation to each other. 

The hobgoblin troopers are setting themselves up in a line to stop our tactician and fury from getting into melee with the hobgoblin war mage. We can all see that happening, and can talk about what we’re going to do to stop it.

That means teamwork matters. That’s why initiative works the way it does—to encourage the players to plan! “Okay, you use *Concussive Slam* on that trooper, it’ll push him back, and on my turn I can use *Phalanx Forward* to get us all into melee with the death captain.”

We think focusing on teamwork also makes the game more heroic! :D

In a tactical game, you have many choices each round. You are never reduced to just swinging your sword. You have options. If we do a good job, you don’t feel like you outlasted your opponents because you wore their hit points down before they could reduce yours to 0—you feel like you beat those hobgoblins! Through stealth and sorcery, coordination and ferocity!

As you play with the same group of characters, you learn what they can all do. You discover synergies, “combos.” Some of them intended by the designers, some not! You start to learn these unique characters, and rely on them to do their cool things. It’s a great feeling when another player comes up with a cool plan that relies on your unique abilities.

You learn which characters are the “squishies” who need to be protected or healed. You learn which characters can push themselves right to the edge and keep fighting. “Don’t worry about healing Barlaca. She’s our fury. She’s happier with 3 Stamina.”

Our game is not about tactics. It’s not a war game. But it is tactical.

## HEROIC

Our game is definitely about heroism! :D

For us, this means a couple of things. It means we don’t assume your character is primarily motivated by greed. They might be! But we don’t assume that. Instead, we assume you’re going to do the right thing. It might take some convincing, and there might be some reluctant heroes in your party, but that’s part of the fun!

You should absolutely be able to run a *Chain of Acheron*-style campaign where the heroes are hard-bitten mercenaries in a morally ambiguous world. But that’s not the baseline assumption. The fiction and adventures that inspire us feature epic villains trying to remake the world in their image, and the dashing, unyielding heroes who strive against them even in the face of impossible odds.

So that’s one component of the heroic keyword. But another component, equally important, is what kinds of things happen “on-screen,” so to speak. This is very closely related to the cinematic keyword.

For instance, you never see Indiana Jones having to find a local sporting goods store because he needs to stock up on ammo. You never see Katniss Everdeen have to stop and take a shower because she stinks.

These things do happen. No one watching *Raiders of the Lost Ark* thinks that Indy’s gun is magical and doesn’t need bullets—but we just don’t need to see Indy doing that stuff. We don’t need to waste time on it.

Likewise in our game, we don’t worry about stuff that heroes in fiction tend not to worry about. We don’t worry how much everything you’re carrying weighs. If you try to lift a bear, you might have trouble, sure. But nowhere on your character sheet are you tracking the weight of every item.

You don’t track food such as rations, and you don’t worry about how many torches you have. Light might factor into a specific environment, because that can be a fun tactical challenge, but the game doesn’t expect that everyone is always worried about running out of light.

Basically, we worry only about those things you’d see your characters doing in a movie, or a comic, or a novel about their adventures. Assume all the tedious stuff happens off-screen.

### CINEMATIC

Closely tied to the heroic keyword, the cinematic keyword is about how we like powers and abilities with a strong visual component. You can imagine your character doing or saying these things. *“In All This Confusion”* is a good name for the shadow’s ability to slip out of melee and retreat to safety. The text of the ability says how it works, but the name creates a visual that explains how it’s working.

When Sir Vanazor the dragon knight fury leaps onto a goblin war spider, cleaving through the goblins riding the creature in a single turn, you can see it in your mind. It feels like a movie. It doesn’t feel simply as if you rolled well, but like an epic scene, complete with slow motion and a Carpenter Brut soundtrack.

You should imagine your tactician character leading the battle, granting your allies free attacks, extra maneuvers. Coordinating the battle. That’s what the name implies. And if we’ve done a good job, when you read the character’s abilities, you think, *“Yes! This is what I was imagining! I can’t wait to do this!”*

### FANTASY

Just … you know … it’s got dragons and stuff. :D

It’s worth mentioning—while everyone basically already knows what fantasy means in this context, we do imagine it a little more broadly than your average classical medieval fantasy. We like that stuff! Vasloria is our medieval European fantasy analog with knights on horseback and wizards in towers. But we also like high fantasy urban intrigue, and so we’re developing *Capital, the City of the Great Game, the Greatest City In This or Any Age*. Vasloria is mostly humans and elves and orcs and dwarves, but Capital has dozens, hundreds of different ancestries in it.

Looking back at movies like *Star Wars* and the work of artists like Chris Foss, that ’70s stuff now seems explicitly fantastical. There’s nothing scientific or even plausible about a lightsaber or a John Berkey spaceship. But damn, they look cool!

So our setting includes the timescape—our multiverse, of which the world of Orden containing Capital and Vasloria is only one part. The timescape is more explicitly *“space fantasy.”*

These core rules mostly cover the classic fantasy stuff. But we think Capital and the timescape will help us deliver a game where more people can see their fantasy in our worlds.

For us, fantasy includes magic, like wizards casting spells, and psionics, the natural and focused ability some creatures have to manipulate and warp reality with their minds. You know, telekinesis and telepathy! Jean Grey style!

### IF YOU’RE COMING FROM D20 FANTASY …

We know many folks are coming to this game having only experienced d20 fantasy RPGs. Here are a few key distinctions between this game and typical d20 fantasy that you’ll notice right away. These aren’t the only distinctions, but they’re the most obvious:

- **Attacks automatically deal damage.** You can still have a bad turn! A tier one result is not awesome, but at least you’re making progress. The trick is: who’s making progress faster? You or the monsters? Since there’s no *“I miss, next”* in this game, fights tend to be short. 5 rounds is a long fight. Because everyone’s always doing damage!

- **You don’t need to rest all the time.** Most d20 fantasy games are games of attrition. Your spell slots and other features dwindle as the adventuring day goes on. In *Draw Steel*, you need to rest to regain your Stamina and Recoveries (the stat that determines how robust you are in combat). But all characters earn the ability to use their magic and other awesome abilities as they adventure, encouraging you to press on heroically.

- **Character options are different.** We very strongly recommend you start by looking through the character creation section before you decide what you want to play. You can’t just assume the conduit is *“basically a cleric.”* In some ways it is! But in other ways, it’s very different. You may have some cool character archetype you love to play in d20 Fantasy and you’re dying to see how it works in *Draw Steel*, but you’ll have a lot more fun if you start by browsing the Ancestries and Class sections and being inspired. Once you know how the game works, you’ll have a better handle on how to build your favorite character in here.

- **Smaller bonuses and penalties** *Draw Steel* is built around the roll of two ten-sided dice to produce three possible outcomes. On the surface, this might not seem that different from rolling a twenty-sided die and having two outcomes, but we’ve run the math. A lot. A bonus of +1 or penalty of −2 is significant in *Draw Steel*, much more so than in a typical d20 fantasy game. That means you should feel pretty good attempting most power rolls—the rolls you make to determine success out of combat—if you have a decent characteristic bonus on those rolls. And if you have a specific skill that applies to a power roll made as a test outside of combat, you’ll do even better.

- **Our game has a lot of skills.** Your character can make use of a long list of skills, but we don’t expect you to memorize that list. We get into why there are so many skills in the *Tests* chapter, but the short version is that we think having a lot of skills allows you to create more distinct and specialized heroes, which supports the sort of gameplay we want to see in *Draw Steel*. And skills in *Draw Steel* aren’t tied to characteristics. If you’re trying to lose someone in a crowd? You can use Presence to Hide! Why not?

- **We won’t be able to point out every difference.** Beyond what’s noted here, don’t assume that these rules work like any d20 fantasy game you’ve played. We don’t have the space to point out every exception. So if you’re in doubt about how something works, put d20 fantasy out of your mind and read our rules without those assumptions, and you’ll find that things make better sense. If you’re still confused, stop by the MCDM Discord and ask. We’ve got tons of awesome community members ready to help!

- **We don’t expect you to do everything to the letter.** This is actually one thing *Draw Steel* does have in common with d20 fantasy. This is a big book of rules! Don’t stress if you need to look something up or make a ruling about an edge case on the fly. If everyone’s having fun, you’re doing it right.

# THE BASICS

The flow of playing *Draw Steel* is like playing any other tabletop roleplaying game with a Director (also called a Game Master or GM in other games). Play is a conversation between the Director and the heroes that describes the story. The Director sets the scene, describing the important elements of the environment that the heroes would notice.

**Director:** You stand in the doorway of the top level of the ruined necromancer’s tower. The air is stale and reeks of death. A pale full moon shines through a broken ceiling, illuminating six sarcophagi upon a raised dais, each with a lid carved in the likeness of a devil. Broken flasks, beakers, and other laboratory glass covers the floor.

After the Director sets the scene, each player describes how their character interacts with the area. The Director then describes how the environment and any creatures in it respond to the heroes’ actions.

**Alyssa (playing Jorn):** I’m going to hang out at the back of the group with my warhammer drawn. I want to be ready in case any of those skeletons we snuck by on the lower levels make their way up the stairs.

**Matt (playing Linn):** Linn uses her *Telekinesis* ability to sweep up the glass on the floor and form a path free of glass that goes from the door to the dais.

**James (playing Korvo):** I’ll light a torch as I step into the room. Is there anything new we can see now?

**Director:** With the glass cleared away and brighter light glowing in the room, you can see that the floor is covered in faded sigils.

At some point, a player will have their hero attempt a task that has a risk of failing in a way that is narratively interesting. In such cases, the Director calls for some dice to be rolled! Don’t worry—the rules outline when and how to do this.

**Grace (playing Val):** Before anyone steps on them, I want to examine the symbols and figure out what they mean.

**Director:** Okay, well for that, I need you to make an easy Reason test.

**Grace:** I got a 12! What do I know?

**Director:** You can tell these old sigils are part of a necromancy spell that has been woven into the stone floor. Also, Jorn can hear something coming up the steps. It’s the clicking and clacking of bone on stone.

**Alyssa:** Uh, let’s make a decision here, folks. We got boneheads incoming!

**Matt:** Linn has had enough of this dillydallying. She moves to the dais and ushers everyone inside the room so we can shut and barricade the door.

**Grace:** Uh-oh.

**Director:** Before anyone else can move, Linn’s foot connects with one of the sigils. A burst of red lightning cracks from the place where her foot touched the floor, running to the walls and up to the ceiling.

**Matt:** Oh, right. Necromancy.

**Grace:** Yeah. Should have warned you.

**Director:** The whole tower starts to sway as the sarcophagus lids slide to the floor and clawed undead hands emerge from within. Six decaying devils, each tattooed with glowing green runes, rise. They’re eager for violence.

**James:** I think we found the Rotting Lords of Hell.

**Director:** Draw steel!

When combat begins, it’s time to use a square-gridded map and miniatures to represent the position of the heroes relative to their enemies and the environment. The rules become a little more granular during combat to keep things interesting and fair, but the idea that the game is a conversation between the Director and the other players remains the same.

## CHARACTERISTICS

Each creature in the game has five characteristics that represent their physical and mental prowess.

### MIGHT

Might (M) represents strength and brawn. A creature’s ability to break down doors, swing an axe, stand up during an earthquake, or hurl an ally across a chasm is determined by Might.

### AGILITY

Agility (A) represents coordination and nimbleness. A creature’s ability to backflip out of danger, shoot a crossbow, dodge an explosion, or pluck keys from a guard’s belt is determined by Agility.

### REASON

Reason (R) represents a logical mind and education. A creature’s ability to solve a puzzle that unlocks a door, recall lore about necromancy, decipher a coded message, or blast a foe with psionic power is determined by Reason.

### INTUITION

Intuition (I) represents instincts and experience. A creature’s ability to recognize a faint sound as the approach of a distant rider, quickly read the tell of a bluffing gambler, calm a rearing horse, or track a monster across the tundra is determined by Intuition.

### PRESENCE

Presence (P) represents force of personality. A creature’s ability to lie to a judge, convince a crowd to join a revolution, impress a queen at a royal banquet, or cast a magic spell by singing a song is determined by Presence.

### CHARACTERISTIC SCORES

Each characteristic has a score that runs from −5 to +5. The higher a score, the more impact the creature has with that characteristic. A baby bunny rabbit would have a Might score of −5, while an ancient dragon would have a Might score of 5. The average human has a score of 0 in all their characteristics. Characteristic scores are added to power rolls—the dice rolls you make whenever your character attempts a task with an uncertain outcome (see *Power Rolls*).

### RESISTING POTENCIES

Many effects inflict conditions and unique statuses on heroes and their enemies. But creatures get a chance to resist these effects. A creature with a high Might score should be harder to knock prone than a creature who is lacking in that characteristic.

These effects have a potency and only take hold of the target if the effect’s potency value is higher than the target’s indicated characteristic scores.

A potency always appears in text as a capital letter followed by a single digit number, such as M1 or R3. The letter indicates which characteristic is used to resist the effect (M for Might, A for Agility, R for Reason, I for Intuition, and P for Presence), and the number indicates the minimum score in that characteristic the target needs to beat the effect.

For example, a 1st-level conduit’s *Punishing Smite* ability has the following power roll outcomes:

- **Power Roll + Intuition:**
  - 11 or lower: 3 holy damage; A1 prone
  - 12–16: 6 holy damage; A2 prone
  - 17+: 9 holy damage; A3 prone and can’t stand (save ends)

If the conduit uses this ability and targets a bandit with an Agility score of 1, then a tier 1 result would deal holy damage to the bandit but have no other effect. But a tier 2 result would deal damage and knock the bandit prone, while a tier 3 result would deal damage, knock the bandit prone, and prevent the bandit from getting up until they succeed on a saving throw.

#### YOUR POTENCY

Many of your abilities have a potency. The characteristic a target uses to resist is based on the ability used, and the value of your potency is based on one of your characteristics and determined by your choice of class during character creation.

You have weak, average, and strong potency values. All of these values increase as your hero advances in level and gains power.

- **Your weak potency value** is equal to your highest characteristic score - 1.
- **Your average potency value** is equal to your highest characteristic score.
- **Your strong potency value** is equal to your highest characteristic score + 1.

## DICE

This game uses ten-sided dice (also called d10s). Each player and the Director should have two of these. Some ten-sided dice are numbered 0 to 9, while others are numbered 1 to 10. In the case of the former, a 0 counts as 10.

The game also makes occasional use of a six-sided die (called a d6), so it’s helpful if each player has one or two of those as well.

### D3S

On rare occasions, the rules ask a player to roll one or more three-sided dice (also called d3s). If you don’t have a d3, you can roll a six-sided die instead, treating a roll of 1–2 as a 1, a roll of 3–4 as a 2, and a roll of 5–6 as a 3.

### D100S

Some tables in this book ask the Director to roll a d100. To roll a d100, grab two ten-sided dice. One die represents the tens digit, and the other die is the ones digit. If you roll a 5 for the tens digit and a 3 for the ones digit, the number rolled is 53.

Some ten-sided dice are numbered 0 to 9, while others are numbered 1 to 10. A 10 on the latter counts as a 0 for the purposes of rolling a d100. If a 10 is rolled for the tens digit and a 9 is rolled for the ones digit, the number rolled is 09 or 9.

If both dice rolled show a 0 or 10 result, then the number rolled is 100.

## POWER ROLLS

Whenever a hero or other creature in the game attempts a task with an uncertain outcome, such as attacking a foe, sneaking by a guard patrol without being seen, or persuading a queen to provide military aid, the creature makes a power roll to determine the outcome of their actions.

#### TYPES OF POWER ROLLS

The game uses three types of power rolls:
- **An ability roll** is used when you activate certain abilities to determine their impact. For instance, if a fury uses their *Brutal Slam* ability to attack an enemy, their ability roll determines how much damage the enemy takes and how far back the enemy is pushed. See *Abilities* for more information.
- **A resistance roll** is a power roll you make to avoid harmful effects, whether generated by another creature’s abilities, the environment, or some other source. See *Resistance Rolls* in *Adventuring* for more information.
- **A test** is a power roll you make outside of using your abilities to affect or interact with the world around you. A tactician might not have an ability that lets them climb up the face of a cliff, so climbing is an activity they can attempt with a test. An elementalist doesn’t have an ability that lets them automatically intimidate a cultist into backing down from a fight, but they can make a test if they want to try. See *Tests* for more information.

### MAKING A POWER ROLL

When you make a power roll, you roll two ten-sided dice (sometimes noted as 2d10 in the rules) and add one of your characteristics.
The characteristic you add depends on the kind of roll you’re making, as outlined in *Abilities* and *Tests*.

#### POWER ROLL OUTCOMES

The result of a power roll determines your outcome tier—three levels that determine how successful your power roll is.

- **Tier 1:** If your power roll result is 11 or lower, it is a tier 1 result. This is the worst result a power roll can have. If you’re using an ability, a tier 1 result means you still do something, but the impact of what you do is minimal. With this result, an attack ability might deal a little bit of damage and not do much else. For a test, a tier 1 result means you fail at what you set out to do, and you might also suffer a negative consequence.
- **Tier 2:** If your power roll result is 12 to 16, it is a tier 2 result. This is the average result of many power rolls, especially for heroes who are 1st level. When using an ability, a tier 2 result means that what you do has a moderate impact. With this result, an attack ability deals a decent amount of damage and has an effect that briefly helps allies or hinders enemies. For a test, a tier 2 result means you might succeed at what you set out to do—though depending on the difficulty, success might have a cost.
- **Tier 3:** If your power roll result is 17 or higher, it is a tier 3 result. This is the best result a power roll can have. When using an ability, a tier 3 result means you deliver the maximum impact possible. With this result, an attack ability deals a lot of damage and has a powerful or lasting effect on enemies or allies. For a test, a tier 3 result means you succeed at what you set out to do. If the test has an easy difficulty, you also get a little something extra in addition to your success.

The specific outcome of any power roll is determined by the effect or ability that requires the roll (see *Abilities*) or the rules for tests (see *Tests*).

### DOWNGRADE A POWER ROLL

Whenever you make a power roll, you can downgrade it to select the result of a lower tier. For instance, if an ability has a tier 3 result that lets you impose the *restrained* condition on a creature, but the tier 2 result for that ability lets you impose the *slowed* condition, you can use the tier 2 result if you would rather have the creature slowed than restrained.

If you downgrade a critical hit, you still get the extra action benefit of the critical hit (see *Critical Hit* in *Abilities*).

### NATURAL RESULT

The result of your power roll before your characteristic or any other modifiers are applied is called the natural result. The rules often refer to this as “rolling a natural X,” where X is the result of the roll. For example, if you get a 20 on the power roll before adding your characteristic, this is called rolling a natural 20.

Whenever you roll a natural 19 or 20 on a power roll, you always achieve the tier 3 result, no matter what characteristic is added to the roll and whether or not the roll has any banes.

### EDGES AND BANES

An archer standing on a castle wall fires down into a throng of enemies, hitting the mark each time thanks to their high ground. A drunken bandit struggles to land blows on sober opponents as alcohol clouds their senses.

Under certain circumstances, you need more than just a characteristic to represent the advantages and disadvantages that heroes, their enemies, and their allies might have.

#### EDGE

An edge represents a situational advantage a hero or an enemy has when making a power roll. For example, a standing hero who makes a melee attack against a prone creature gains an edge on the power roll for their attack. A pair of magic gloves that makes your hands sticky might grant you an edge when making a power roll to climb walls!

When you make a power roll with a single edge, you add 2 to the roll. If you make a power roll with two or more edges, you have a *double edge*. This means you don’t add anything to the power roll, but the result of the roll automatically improves one tier (to a maximum of tier 3).

#### BANE

A bane represents a situational disadvantage a hero or an enemy has when making a power roll. For example, if you make an attack while prone, the power roll for the attack takes a bane. A rainstorm might give you a bane on a power roll made to climb an outdoor wall because the weather makes the stone surface extra slick.

When you make a power roll with a single bane, you subtract 2 from the roll. If you make a power roll with two or more banes, you have a *double bane*. This means you don’t subtract anything from the power roll, but the result of the roll automatically decreases one tier (to a minimum of tier 1).

### ROLLING WITH EDGES AND BANES

Under certain circumstances, you might have one or more edges and banes on the same roll. For instance, you might take a bane when weakened by poison, even as you gain an edge for attacking a prone creature. In general, edges and banes cancel each other out, resolving as follows:

- If you have an edge and a bane, or if you have a double edge and a double bane, the roll is made as usual without any edges or banes.
- If you have a double edge and just one bane, the roll is made with one edge, regardless of how many single edge instances contribute to the double edge.
- If you have a double bane and just one edge, the roll is made with one bane, regardless of how many single bane instances contribute to the double bane.

### WHEN TO USE EDGES AND BANES

The rules tell you when to modify a roll with an edge or a bane. The Director can also modify rolls with edges and banes as a response to narrative or environmental circumstances. For instance, no rule specifically says that rain imposes a bane on power rolls made to climb a stone wall.But it makes sense that rainy conditions should make climbing that wall harder, so a Director should absolutely do so!

### WHY CAP?

We capped edges and banes at a maximum of two each for several reasons, including thinking about the narrative of those penalties. Every little advantage or disadvantage in a heroic story has diminishing returns, acknowledging that a creature can only benefit or be hindered by short-term circumstances so much. For example, a character who is prone and weakened by poison already finds it difficult to attack—so becoming restrained by a net can’t really make it harder.

We also liked capping edges and banes at two because it keeps play quick. It’s nice to not need to count beyond two positive or negative circumstances in a battle with a lot of effects flying around.

### BONUSES AND PENALTIES

While edges and banes cover most circumstantial effects that can have an impact on a power roll, a few rules add numeric bonuses or penalties to power rolls. Bonus and penalty values are specified in the rules that impose them, and are calculated independently of edges and banes, and before edges and banes are factored into a power roll.

There is no limit to the number of bonuses or penalties that can apply to a power roll, and bonuses and penalties always add together.

Though it might sound as if the math with bonuses and penalties can get confusing, fear not! Bonuses and penalties are rare except in the case of skills, which appear on your character sheet (see *Skills* for more information).

### SURGE AND SHIELD SYMBOLS

In the text of this book, you’ll notice that we often use two symbols—🌟 and 🛡️. Surges, represented by the 🌟 icon, are special bonuses that increase a creature’s damage output. Shields, represented by the 🛡️ icon, are special bonuses that decrease damage being dealt to a creature. For more information, see *Damage in Combat*.

### HERO TOKENS

In all great heroic stories, luck favors the protagonists, giving them that little bit of extra fortune they need to win the day. In these stories, fate is often on the side of the righteous.

To represent that tiny bit of karma, players have access to hero tokens, a special resource that they can rely on when all else fails.

Hero tokens are a group resource that is tracked by the players and kept in a pool that is accessible to all their characters. They can be tracked using poker chips, stones, or other markers, or numerically on a piece of paper or written off to the side in a virtual tabletop.

#### EARNING HERO TOKENS

At the start of a new game session, the heroes have a number of hero tokens equal to the number of heroes in the party. The heroes can earn more tokens through play by taking big risks to save others. A hero who leaps off a cliff to get to the bottom and aid a friend, who crosses a burning bridge to save a stray cat, or who wagers their most prized treasure as part of a negotiation to get shelter for a group of refugees earns a hero token for the group. The Director has the final say in what acts earn hero tokens.

Players can also be awarded hero tokens as part of a test’s outcome when they succeed in a task with a reward (see *Tests*).

#### SPENDING HERO TOKENS

Whenever hero tokens are available, you can spend them in the following ways. You can only spend one hero token on your turn or per test:

- You can spend a hero token whenever you deal damage to a creature to deal additional damage to the creature equal to your level + your highest characteristic score.
- You can spend a hero token when you fail a saving throw to succeed on it instead.
- When you fail a test or succeed on a test with a consequence, you can spend a hero token to turn the failure into a success and to lose any consequence suffered.
- You can spend 2 hero tokens on your turn or whenever you take damage (no action required) to regain Stamina equal to your Recovery value without spending a Recovery.

Unless the Director decides otherwise, unused hero tokens disappear at the end of a session. A Director may lift this restriction if the heroes end a session with more hero tokens than they had at the start.

### FOR THE DIRECTOR: AWARDING HERO TOKENS

You can award hero tokens to the players for taking risks with their heroes beyond what the game typically expects of them. For instance, battling a group of monsters is part of the game and doesn’t earn a hero token. However, the following sorts of activities might:

- A hero stands alone against a group of enemies to allow their comrades to escape.
- A hero willingly jumps into quicksand, into lava, off a cliff, or into some other hazard to save another character.
- The group is presented with an easy way out of a difficult situation that involves lying, cheating, stealing, or the like, but they take the more arduous and honorable path.
- A hero gives away an important resource, such as a Healing Potion, to help another creature in need.

### GAME OF EXCEPTIONS

This game has a fair number of rules. But it also has plenty of character options, specialized equipment, and other game elements that let you break those rules. This is on purpose! Breaking the rules allows heroes to feel special and makes their foes seem extra dangerous.

If you’re not sure what to do when two rules come into conflict with each other, remember that a specific exception always beats a more general rule. The Director has the final say in how rules are adjudicated.

### ALWAYS ROUND DOWN

There are times when the rules tell you to divide a number in half. Whenever you divide an odd number in half and it results in a decimal, round the result down to the nearest whole number. For instance, if you have a speed of 7 and become slowed (a condition that halves your speed), then your speed becomes 3.

### CREATURES AND OBJECTS

This game uses the terms “creature” and “object.” Creatures are living or unliving beings such as animals, elves, humans, dragons, giants, zombies, and valok. Objects are inanimate matter such as walls, carriages, cups, swords, ropes, coins, paintings, columns, and buildings.

When a creature dies, their body becomes an object and can be affected by abilities and other effects that target objects. For example, a talent can’t use their *Telekinesis* power to slide an unwilling enemy cult leader into an evil temple’s pit of hellfire. But if that boss dies, the talent can slide their body into the pit to prevent the boss from being raised as a powerful undead by the temple’s magic.

The game sometimes refers to “unattended objects,” which are objects that aren’t held, worn, or controlled by a creature. Whenever an ability affects objects, it affects only unattended objects unless the Director determines otherwise. Among other things, this prevents abilities from being used to damage a foe’s armor, weapons, clothing, magic items, and so forth while those objects are worn or held.

### PCS AND NPCS

Two types of characters inhabit the world of the game—the player characters (also called PCs or heroes) who are created and controlled by the players, and nonplayer characters (NPCs) created and controlled by the Director.

NPCs can include any of the game’s monsters, but when the rules refer to NPCs, they generally do so in the context of interacting with them outside of combat.

### BUILDING A HEROIC NARRATIVE

The game takes place in a series of scenes with the heroes as the main characters. An adventure is a collection of scenes that make up a story, with a beginning, middle, and end, and a campaign is a collection of adventures that tell the entire epic tale of a group of heroes. You can think of each adventure as a movie in a saga of films, a book in a series of novels, or a season of a television show.

While many heroes have their stories told over the course of a campaign, some wrap up their careers in a single adventure that takes place in one game session, called a one-shot. You can think of a one-shot as a great stand-alone novella or movie.

This game is built so that each adventure you play and each battle you fight gets more exciting as it goes on. In fantastic tales, the heroes and their foes both grow in power over the course of an adventure. But it isn’t time alone that grows a hero’s capabilities. Rather, it’s the adrenaline that comes from battle, the danger of the hero’s profession, and the pressure to save the world that pushes a character to do the impossible. Each small act of heroism gives a hero the confidence and bravery to perform legendary feats against all odds.

The things a hero can achieve at the end of the story are far more daring and impactful than what they do at the start, and the final showdown against a villain’s forces is more deadly and desperate than the first. The rules of the game help build a heroic narrative in this same fashion, making use of the four most important mechanics for building heroic narratives: Victories, Experience, Heroic Resources, and Recoveries.

### VICTORIES

Victories measure your hero’s increasing power over the course of an adventure, as they overcome battles and other challenges. At the start of an adventure, your hero has 0 Victories.

#### VICTORIES FOR COMBAT

Each time your hero survives a combat encounter in which the party’s objectives are achieved, your Victories increase by 1. The Director can decide that a trivially easy encounter doesn’t increase a hero’s Victories.

#### VICTORIES FOR NONCOMBAT CHALLENGES

When your hero successfully overcomes a big challenge that doesn’t involve combat, the Director can award you 1 Victory. Such challenges can include things like a particularly complicated and deadly trap, a negotiation, a montage test, a complicated puzzle, or the execution of a clever idea that avoids a battle.

### VICTORIES RESET

Whenever you finish a respite (see *Respite*), your Victories are converted into Experience.

### FOR THE DIRECTOR: AWARDING VICTORIES

We’re still figuring out rules for encounter building, but here are some general guidelines.

A successful combat in which the party’s objectives are achieved earns the heroes 1 Victory. Particularly hard encounters are worth 2 Victories when completed. We'll have better guidelines on this topic in the future, but for now, consider tough boss battles worth 2 Victories.

A successful negotiation or montage test should earn the heroes 1 Victory. Other noncombat challenges are left to the Director’s discretion, but consider the following guidelines to help you determine when awarding 1 Victory is warranted:

- If the heroes overcome a complicated trap that requires more than one test to find and disarm, award them 1 Victory.
- If the heroes investigate a series of clues in a mystery, award 1 Victory when they solve the mystery.
- If the heroes solve a complicated puzzle that requires them to use resources or would take most people at least 10 minutes to complete, award them 1 Victory.
- If the heroes achieve a major story goal that accomplishes a quest (such as saving a prince trapped by an evil baroness or stopping a necromancer from performing a world-ending ritual), award them 1 Victory.
- If the heroes use clever thinking to easily and surprisingly overcome or bypass a combat encounter, a negotiation, a montage test, a trap, a puzzle, or some other challenge that would award them 1 or more Victories in a more difficult fashion, award them 1 Victory. Clever thinking is just as worthy of a Victory—if not more so!

At the Director’s discretion, particularly hard negotiations, puzzles, mysteries, and other noncombat challenges can be worth 2 Victories.

### EXPERIENCE

Victories temporarily increase a hero’s power during an adventure, but Experience (or XP) permanently improves their capabilities. Each time you finish a respite (see below), you gain XP equal to your Victories, then your Victories drop to 0. In other words, your Victories are converted to XP when you finish a respite.

For more information on how XP increases your hero’s power, see *Heroic Advancement*.

### HEROIC RESOURCES

Your hero has a Heroic Resource determined by your class, and which you manage during play. Earning resources can increase your hero’s power, and Resources are spent to activate your most powerful abilities.

Your hero’s class description has more information about how to use your Heroic Resource.

### BAGS OF RATS AIN'T HEROIC

Some players might think that quickly starting a fight with some bar patrons or carrying around a bag of rats is a good way to gather up those sweet, sweet Victories and Heroic Resources. Those strategies don’t work! The rules of the game exist to help you tell a cool heroic fantasy story, not so you can try to be clever and exploit them by harming innocent rats to “win.” In order to generate Victories and Heroic Resources, you must face and overcome challenges worthy of a hero!

### RECOVERIES

Recoveries represent the number of times your hero can take a breather and keep fighting. Running out of Recoveries means your hero has reached their uttermost limit. You can spend your Recoveries with a special action (see below) or you might get a little magical help from a conduit, a boost of adrenaline from an allied tactician, or inspiration from your party’s troubadour.

When you spend a Recovery, you regain Stamina equal to your recovery value, which is one-third your Stamina maximum.

#### SPENDING RECOVERIES

During combat encounters and similarly dangerous situations when time is tracked in rounds (see *Combat*), you can use the *Catch Breath* action to regain Stamina. See *Catch Breath* in *Actions* for more information. Some heroes have abilities that allow them or their allies to spend more Recoveries without using the *Catch Breath* action.

Outside of combat and other dangerous situations, you can spend Recoveries freely.

#### REGAINING RECOVERIES

You regain all lost Recoveries when you finish a respite (see *Respite*).

### RESPITE

A respite is a focused period of rest and recuperation that allows heroes to regain Stamina and Recoveries. During a respite, you must spend 24 hours uninterrupted and doing nothing but sleeping, eating, dressing your wounds, and recuperating in a safe place. You can also undertake one respite activity, such as making a project roll (see *Research and Crafting* in future packets for more information), or changing your kit (see *Kits*).

When you finish a respite, you regain all your Recoveries and Stamina, and your Victories convert to Experience. It is best to take a respite in a safe place where you aren’t in a hostile environment or at risk of being attacked. If your respite is interrupted by enemies attacking, an earth tremor, swarms of biting insects, or similar serious distractions, the respite ends early and you don’t gain the benefits for finishing it.

The standard eight-ish hours of sleep one gets at night doesn’t count as a respite. The rules assume that all heroes take the time to sleep, eat, and take care of all the other functions necessary for life even if they aren’t engaged in a respite.

## ORDEN AND THE TIMESCAPE

A new game demands new worlds! Welcome to the timescape—a collection of worlds spanning high fantasy, dark fantasy, and even space fantasy! We sincerely hope you take these rules and adapt them to your own world, or adapt your world to these rules, or something in between!

Our tour begins on the world of Orden, the Prime Manifold—a realm of elves, dwarves, humans, orcs, dragons, and more. But human civilization and politics dominate here, especially in the great city of Capital, a hotbed of urban fantasy intrigue.

Orden contains seven major regions, the largest of which is Vasloria.

### VASLORIA

A forested medieval and feudal land, Vasloria holds few cities—just towns and villages. Western Vasloria, including most of Aendrim and Corwell and parts of Graid, was until recently ruled by Good King Omund. His draconian knights, the Dragon Phalanx, protected the weak from the strong, dispensing justice throughout the land. But Omund died fifteen years ago—and so died the rule of law in Vasloria. Now, forests claim towns and roads once held safe under his rule. The woods are dangerous, their only law that of tooth and claw.

When Omund was betrayed by Mandrake, a captain of the Dragon Phalanx, his castle fell to Ajax the Invincible—now called the Overlord and the Iron Saint. Ajax’s wizard Mortum unlocked the secret of the ancient flying cities of the sky elves to raise the Chrysopolis, Ajax’s city-fortress in the sky.

Ajax abolished all faiths and temples in Vasloria. He executed the dukes who served King Omund loyally, leaving only the three surviving baronies of Dalrath, Bedegar, and Tor to hold human civilization together. Once, the people of all the lands of Vasloria were loose allies. There was trade between humans, elves, dwarves, and orcs.

Now there is only suspicion.

The high elves of the Fallen City, once the sky elf city of Irranys, pay tribute to Ajax with ancient artifacts they plunder from their ruined home. The wode elves of the Orchid Court, lacking any centralized government or cities, refuse to bow to the Iron Saint.

The dwarves of Kal Kalavar pay tribute in prisoners they abduct from among those foolish enough to travel the roads unescorted—prisoners who serve Ajax as forced labor or are fed into the Body Banks. Brooding under the mountains in their fabled Hanging City of Kal Kalavar, the stone dwarves do not like this deal with the Overlord, but they lack the power—or perhaps the will—to rebel.

The Hawklords of the High Aerie now act as Ajax’s royal guard. Mounted on their giant hawks, these human warriors project Ajax’s power, enforce his tyrannical order, and extend his influence into every corner of the wilderness. Their mastery of the air means that any revolt or rebellion is seen and crushed quickly. The Dragon Phalanx is broken now, its knights scattered.

Ajax has placed a high bounty on their heads. Some folk still see Omund’s knights as symbols of justice, heroes of a lost age before might made right. But in every town, every village, there are always desperate people willing to collect the bounty, summoning the Hawklords to pluck any dragon knight foolish enough to travel without a disguise away to the Chrysopolis.

The peoples of Dalrath, Bedegar, and Tor, isolated and outnumbered, desperately fight a losing battle against the encroaching wilderness. Law dies. Chaos thrives.

### CAPITAL

The Greatest City in This or Any Age! City of the Great Game! Located west across the Bale Sea from Vasloria on the eastern coast of Rioja, Capital is not only the largest city in Orden. It’s the largest city there has ever been—larger than the fabled steel dwarf capital of Kalas Valiar, larger even than Alloy, the City at the Center of the Timescape. Capital is the exception to many rules.

It is a city of playwrights and opera, of spies and sorcery. Famed throughout the world as a city of high magic where flying tapestries act as taxis. But the reality of living in Capital is somewhat more mundane, for only the very wealthy can afford such luxuries.

### THE GREAT HOUSES

The Great Houses, Capital’s ancient noble families, reluctantly share power with the upstart guilds who think that their vast wealth entitles them to rule. The members of the Great Houses are proud of their city, and believe anyone, from anywhere, should be able to come to Capital and earn a living, own property, expect justice. They just don’t think anyone else should be able to rule. The guilds of the city, by contrast, are more egalitarian, more democratic, largely obsessed with accruing wealth—and caring little for the welfare of the city or its people.

The Great Game is espionage, and House Alvaro are the best players in the world. Led by Duke Prospero, House Alvaro sponsors the Imperial University, the greatest center of learning in the world. Nobles from across Orden, including from lands as far away as Vanigar, send their children to learn diplomacy and statecraft at the university. The greatest spies in the world are all graduates of the Actian School, one of the university’s many colleges, which once doubled as the intelligence agency of Capital’s late prince.

House Vorona runs the city’s navy, the largest military organization of any kind in Orden. Their engineers perfected the secret of blackpowder and guard it jealously. The Imperial Navy’s cannons protect trade across Orden, placing Capital at the center of international affairs. Vorona’s Far Mariners, aka the marines, are the closest thing to a citywide law enforcement organization. Each Great House is expected to police its own district.

Duke Marco Vorona sponsors the Imperial War College, also known as the Academy. A prestigious institution rivaling any college of the Imperial University, the Academy boasts graduates among all the noble families in Orden. This widespread allegiance creates a vast informal network in the city, referred to cynically as the Old Class Ring, that gives House Vorona access to intelligence that other factions can only dream of.

House Navarr, the oldest of the Great Houses, enforces the law of the Church of Saint Ysabella the Pitiless, which they call justice. The house is led by His Grace Orsino, Duke Navarr, archbishop of that most powerful church in the city. Under his rule, House Navarr consolidates a vast network of different churches and knights across the region under one elaborate system of patronage.

Arguably the most powerful Great House, House Valetta controls the city’s tax collectors, known as the Arbitros Fiat. Valetta is led by the Duchess Lenore, who opened the Codex Mortis while in mourning for her assassinated husband Maximo, speaking a ritual from that ancient necromantic artifact that should have returned her love to life. Instead, she brought about the Lilac Night, which transformed everyone in her district into undead—including herself. The Duchess Lenore is now an immortal vampire queen, a dead lady ruling over a dead city.

### THE POWER OF THE GUILDS

After the Lilac Night, with the city no longer able to rely on House Valetta to deliver the taxes it collected, Lady Shirome bought Great House status for the Fulcrum—the city’s assayer’s guild she controls—along with the Broadsheet Guild and the Farrier’s Guild. The Fulcrum controls the Trade Integrity Board, which sets lending rates and leads trade negotiations between Capital and other governments in Orden. It was that guild that convinced the late prince to switch the city to paper money. As a result, Capital is the first and only city in Orden to have a robust monetary policy.

The Broadsheet Guild, formally known as the Font, publishes the thrice-daily news sheets that everyone in the city reads. Guildmaster Inān al-Adwiyya uses a vast network of young people called the Paperfeathers to deliver and sell the broadsheets throughout the city. Lady al-Adwiyya knows almost everything happening anywhere in Capital.

The Farrier’s Guild, popularly known as the Rasp, controls transport throughout the city. The guild is led by Lord Kashimir, a heliox from the planar gateway city of Alloy. It was he who introduced the flying tapestries that metaphorically shrank Capital, allowing the rich and powerful to cross the thirteen-mile-wide city in just a few minutes. He also created the Kites, couriers famous for being able to get a message to anywhere in Capital in only a few hours. His monopoly on importing flying tapestries from Alloy gives Lord Kashimir enormous power, and he is not shy about wanting more.

### THE MYRIAD WORLDS OF THE TIMESCAPE

Orden is only one world in the timescape! Each star in the night sky is another world, though this fact is not known to most people living on Orden. Higher worlds are more energetic, affording access to alien technologies. Great star freighters ply the space lanes, with knights wielding psionically powered hard-light blades dueling against star pirates with hard-light blasters.

The lower worlds lack the energy necessary for such extraordinary technology to function and so rely on magic to break the rules.

On Axiom, the Plane of Uttermost Law, the memonek live on a world teeming with complex, inorganic life. UNISOL, the Universal Solar League, ensures and protects trade across the upper worlds, defending the star freighters from pirates such as the time raiders and the infamous Sunrunners on their legendary ship the *K.R.A.D Fearless*.

Meanwhile, on Proteus, the Sea of Eternal Change, the formless proteans rebelled against the synlirii who once ruled the plane of uttermost chaos, exiling the voiceless talkers to the World Below. Now the masters of their world, the proteans take to the stars in their living change-ships, hurling their small fleet against what they perceive as the tyrannical might of UNISOL.

On Quintessence, the lowest of the upper worlds, proteans and memonek alike rub shoulders with devils, fire dwarves, and even humans in Quintessence’s capital city of Alloy, the City at the Center of the Timescape. The Free City of Alloy, also known as the City of Brass, is the gateway to the timescape. People traveling to or from the upper and lower worlds meet here to trade goods and information, free from the inflexible laws of UNISOL.

Traveling downward from Quintessence, one arrives on Orden, the Plane of Gods and Sorcery, highest of the lower worlds where magic rules. The gods, forbidden from interfering directly in a world with such a low energy state, rely on saints to enact their will. The technology from the upper worlds does not function down here, unless powered by a strong psionic mind or the miracle mineral prismacore.

Almost coterminous with Orden is its sister-plane, the World Below, the Dark Under All. This plane of exiles is ruled by A Lie Cloaked In Star’s Silver—the Queen of Night, and the first of the Three Sisters Below. The World Below is a land of vast caves and sunless seas. There are no stars here, no sky, only endless caves and warrens. Some of those are vast enough to hold entire cities, including Or-Mazaar, the City of the Black Sun, from where the Queen of Night rules.

The power of the World Below wanes, even as the power of Equinox waxes. Also known as Dusk, this smaller parasitic manifold is home to the exiled shadow elves and ruled by the Queen of Shadows, third of the Three Sisters Below. She plots to return her people to their homeland in Orden, and to escape the twisted shadow world.

The last plane of law, the Seven Cities of Hell, is among the lowest of the lower planes. A realm of devils proud of their civilization, the Seven Cities are each ruled by an archduke who schemes to ascend to the Throne of Hell. Living in a world of bureaucratic law, the devil denizens of Hell have little interest in the other planes. Life is so much more interesting down here. The seven dukes of hell conspired together once, agreeing to create the Order of Desolation, also known as the illriggers. Doing so was meant to extend their power into the timescape, and to defend the Seven Cities from the demon hordes below.

The demons of the Abyssal Waste, the lowest plane, claw and scramble over each other, competing for souls in this heat-blasted desert under a baleful, giant orange sun.

Mindless collections of organs, claws, and teeth, demons collect souls until they reach sentience, gaining identity and the blessing of memory. These demons will do anything to escape upward out of the wasteland, lest they lose their collected souls, lose their identities, and fall into that mindless state called lethe.

At the center of the Abyssal Waste lies the Necropolitan Ruin, the Last City. A great city of the dead, the site is ruled by Khorsekef, once the Infinite Pharaoh of the desert wasteland of Khemhara, now the Ultralich. Khorsekef intends to return to Orden and sit once again on his throne in the grand Heliopolis at the center of Khemhara—and he has a plan …

### THE TIMESCAPE IN YOUR GAME

We use the timescape and its medieval fantasy land Orden as the default setting presented in these books. Doing so makes it easier for us as designers to marry our design with real examples from a real (imaginary) fantasy world. We also think it’s easier for you to take the names for places, languages, and gods, and replace them with your own. We might reference some hero or villain, saint or god, whose name makes you think, “Well, I don’t have that in my setting.” If we do a good job, though, you might be inspired to say, “But that makes me think …” And being inspired is part of the fun!

If you’re the Director, you can use as many or as few of the details of the timescape as you like. You might wish to create your own world within the timescape, or use a setting you’ve created that exists outside of the official MCDM manifolds. You can use details from settings published by other companies. There are no rules when it comes to world-building. Feel free to take what you like from this book and change the rest. For example, you might not care for our dwarves having literal stone skin. That’s fine. You can make them fleshy, stout, bearded folk, or mohawked, barrel-chested punk rockers, or anything else you wish. As long as you’re running a heroic fantasy campaign about fighting monsters, then the game’s rules are still likely to serve your narrative even if that narrative deviates from ours.

If you’re a player, ask your Director about the setting where the game takes place and discuss with them the sort of hero you want to create. Maybe you want to play a more traditional gruff and bearded dwarf rather than go all short and stony. An open dialogue and honest discussion with your Director can lead to everyone getting what they want out of the game.

### ECHELONS OF PLAY

The core gameplay experience of Draw Steel takes place over 10 levels of play. At 1st level, player characters are already known as heroes and have the power to save their local village. By 10th level, people all over the world know the names of their saviors … maybe all the worlds!

Since this game encompasses power levels from hometown to demigods, the core experience has been divided into four different echelons, which indicate the types of threats the heroes take on, the stakes of their stories, and the rewards they receive at various levels of play.

#### 1ST ECHELON (LEVELS 1–3)

The 1st echelon of play encompasses levels 1 to 3. At this echelon, the player characters are local heroes. They save lost caravans, besieged villages, and overlooked neighborhoods of cities. The heroes battle bands of mortal humanoids—dwarves, elves, goblins, humans, kobolds, orcs. They face the occasional larger monstrous threat, such as a bredbeddle, ogre, or chimera. These are the kinds of creatures that can threaten a small community, but rarely have plans for world domination or the destruction of the timescape. However, the adversaries might work for or be manipulated by a stronger threat as a foreshadowing of what awaits the hero at higher echelons.

#### 2ND ECHELON (LEVELS 4–6)

The 2nd echelon of play encompasses levels 4 to 6. At this echelon, heroes are now known throughout the wider region they serve. In Vasloria, this means that they’re saving and celebrated by an entire country. In Capital, their reputation and work now encompasses several different neighborhoods of the enormous city. Heroes of the timescape might be known for saving a planet!

Heroes in this echelon battle humanoids of great supernatural power, such as draconians, devils, and hobgoblins. The bosses they face possess cunning and ambition as great as their terrible power, such as medusas and overminds. Heroes at this level also face the humanoid threats of earlier levels, but these foes are their villainous counterparts of equal power instead of bands of ruffians or marauding armies.

#### 3RD ECHELON (LEVELS 7–9)

The 3rd echelon of play encompasses levels 7 to 9. At this echelon, heroes are saving and known throughout the setting where they serve. Most folks in Vasloria, Capital, or the timescape itself know of the heroes and are grateful for their efforts saving the continent, massive city, or many worlds, respectively. Foes at this echelon include beings of great power, such as giants, vampires, and valok.

#### 4TH ECHELON (LEVEL 10)

The 4th echelon of play encompasses level 10 (and possibly beyond in future products). At this echelon, heroes are saving the entire timescape from threats like liches, powerful dragons, and Ajax the Invincible.

# MAKING A HERO

If you’re not the Director, then you create and play one of the main characters in the game’s story—a hero. Your hero is a person motivated to fight forces of evil to protect the innocent, but each hero has their own personal reason for doing so. You don’t have to be a pure beacon of good. Heroes have flaws and are complex, just like people in the real world. But your hero should be someone who isn’t afraid to battle monsters for altruistic reasons. If you’re only interested in playing a money-grubbing sellsword, you can achieve that with these rules, but you’ll likely be happier playing another game.

The hero you create will be roleplayed by you. Often when referring to your hero, the rules use second-person pronouns (you/your) for shorthand, only making a distinction between you and your hero when that distinction is important.

## YOUR FIRST SESSION

Getting together with your friends to make characters can be a lot of fun. Many groups spend most of their first session talking about the campaign’s story, making heroes, and going over expectations for the game. It’s a great way to kick off a long-term campaign.

The Director should make an agenda for a campaign’s first session—often called “session zero”—which can include any of the following items:

- The Director and players talk about the safety tools they want to employ at the game table (whether physical or virtual), so that everyone has a good time and understands which topics should be avoided in the game’s narrative and which should be embraced. For more information, check out the MCDM Tabletop Safety Toolkit at [mcdm.gg/SafetyToolkit](http://mcdm.gg/SafetyToolkit), which includes advice for running a successful session zero.
- The Director discusses the campaign’s world and the major story themes they want to introduce into the game.
- The Director should tell the players if there are any options that are limited or rare in their campaign. For example, some Director’s don’t want psionics to make an appearance in their game worlds, so they might decide that heroes can’t be nulls or talents. Another campaign might be grounded in more typical medieval fantasy and not have any memonek or time raiders, or those ancestries might be exceedingly rare, leading heroes with those ancestries to get a lot of questions from curious NPCs.
- The players get a chance to tell the Director what they would like to see in the campaign. This can include anything from “I’d love to play out some chase scenes!” to “I want to explore themes of loss and grief.” These wishes should be starting points for a conversation. If not all players are comfortable with certain themes or content requested by other players, then session zero is a great time to discuss that and come to a consensus about what everyone wants out of the game.
- Make heroes! Once everyone understands what the campaign is about, it’s the perfect time to get into character creation. When a group of players make heroes together, they can tie backstories together and strategize to build a tactically dominant party both in and out of combat.
- The Director runs an encounter to kick off the campaign. If all the players have the time, it’s totally worth it to get some play in during the first session, even if it’s just a quick brawl in a tavern with some cultists! Giving the players a little action lets them see what the game is all about—and leaves them excited for the next session.

## STEP-BY-STEP HERO MAKING

Use the following step-by-step guide to create a hero. These steps are presented in what we believe is the best way to approach making your first hero for Draw Steel. That said, the order of the steps is still a suggestion, not a hard and fast rule.

Many players like to build a hero from the backstory up, making ancestry and culture ideal first choices. However, some players like to start more in the present, choosing an inciting incident and a class—the choices with the most potential impact on what your character can do in the game—and then going back and figuring out where their hero came from. There’s no wrong way to do it!

You’ll want a character sheet to fill out while you make your hero.

> **Playtest note:** The character sheet is still to come.

### 1. THINK

The first thing you should do is think about the kind of hero you want to make. Ask yourself the following questions:

- Do you fight with weapons, magic, psionics, or some combination of these abilities?
- Outside of combat, what do you want your hero to do well?
- What did you do before becoming a hero?
- Why did you choose to become a hero?
- What is your personality like?
- What people, places, and objects are important to you?
- How will your hero complement the strengths and weaknesses of the other heroes?

### AMBITION IS GOOD!

Heroes are not just along for the ride in the Director’s story. They’re active participants, who make decisions that change their communities and eventually worlds or even the entirety of the timescape! It is good for your hero to have desires, to want to found an organization, seek justice for someone who was wronged, or want to craft a magic sword that will help you defeat your foes. It’s only when that personal ambition becomes more important than the group’s story that it becomes a problem. But if you share your character’s ambitions with your Director, they can weave those desires in with the narrative. Character creation is a great time to do this.

As the story evolves, your hero’s ambitions could change. That’s not a bad thing—dynamic characters are awesome. If they do, make sure you have a conversation with your Director about it, so they can plan accordingly.

### 2. ANCESTRY

Choose your hero’s humanoid ancestry from among the range of ancestries available in the game—devil, dragon knight, dwarf, hakaan, high elf, human, memonek, orc, polder, revenant, time raider, or wode elf. Future supplements will introduce additional ancestries you can choose from. See Ancestries for more information.

### 3. CULTURE

Create your hero’s culture. Although ancestry gives your hero a number of physiological benefits, your culture describes the community that raised you and gives you languages and skills. See Culture for more information.

### 4. CAREER

Choose your hero’s career, which describes what you did for a living before you became a hero. Your career gives you skills and a title, and might also give you languages, Renown, or knowledge for crafting and research. See Careers for more information.

#### I SPEAK THEIR LANGUAGE

Choosing languages at the start of a campaign can be hard, because you might not know which are going to be the most impactful for a game. You can choose to keep some of the languages you know blank until you discover what might be a good choice for the campaign you’re playing in. Once you decide to take a language, you can reveal your choice in a dramatic moment, perhaps during a negotiation where your language would help or just after you find a tome that no other hero in your crew can read.

### 5. CLASS

Choose your hero’s class. This choice has the biggest impact on how your hero interacts with the rules of the game, especially the rules for combat. Your class provides your characteristic scores and Stamina, in addition to skills, several abilities, and other benefits. You can be a censor, conduit, elementalist, fury, null, shadow, tactician, talent, or troubadour. See Classes for more information.

### 6. KIT

If your class gives your hero a kit, choose your hero’s kit. Your kit provides you with equipment and a fighting style that grants a signature ability and bonuses to one or more of your game statistics.

### 7. ADD FREE STRIKES

The simplest and most basic attack you can make, categorically worse than every other option, free strike abilities are those attacks you can make when it’s not your turn. An enemy is foolish enough to walk away from you in melee? Free strike! Every hero has both a melee and ranged weapon free strike, they’re all the same (until modified by your kit or class) and it’s up to you to decide what exactly these attacks are. A thrown dagger? A punch? The design is intended to let you use your imagination.

Free strikes also let you make attacks on your turn even if your hero isn’t otherwise themed to do so. A bow-using wode elf can still stab an enemy with a dagger as a free strike, and a greataxe-wielding orc fury can still pull out a hand axe and hurl it at a flying enemy staying annoyingly out of melee range as a free strike.

#### MELEE WEAPON FREE STRIKE

See Free Strikes for more information on using free strikes, and see Abilities for information on the ability format.

### 8. COMPLICATION

Complications represent those dramatic moments in a character’s backstory that give them pathos, a dramatic reason to be an outsider, to doubt the meaning of their life, to avoid intimacy, or rage against an enemy from their past. Complications grant a benefit and a drawback. They can make a character more three-dimensional, but they are not necessary for making a great hero. Check with your Director to make sure your game is using them. See Complications for more information.

### 9. DETERMINE DETAILS

Once you’ve created your hero, it’s time to determine the additional details of their backstory, appearance, and personality. How do the events of their culture, career, inciting incident, and class tie together into a cohesive narrative? What’s their name? What do they look like? Do they have any cool scars? Any dope tattoos? Do they still sleep with their teddy bear? These sorts of details can help define a well-rounded hero.

### 10. MAKE CONNECTIONS

Ask the Director if all the heroes start the campaign knowing each other. If they do, talk to the other players and build some connections between your heroes. If you like, you can use the following prompts to make those connections, or to come up with prompts of your own:

- While fighting a monster, another hero saved your life. What were you battling and who saved you?

- In your group, who looks after everyone’s health and well-being and makes sure that all the characters get along? If it’s not you, how do you view this other hero?
- Who is the grumpiest member of your party? If it isn’t you, how do you react to that hero’s sour nature? If it is you, how do you react to other characters teasing you or trying to cheer you up?
- What’s one thing your fellow heroes know about you that other people do not?
- What’s your favorite way to bond with your fellow heroes?
- You’ve known one of the other heroes in your party longer than the rest. Who is it, and how did you meet?
- Another hero creates food, music, clothing, trinkets, or something else that you enjoy. Who is that hero and what do they make?
- Another hero is teaching you a new skill. Who is it, and what are they teaching you?

Answer these questions with the other players present, and be sure to get a player’s approval if your answer makes use of their character.

## CHOOSING SKILLS

This game has lots of skills, and lots of opportunities during character creation to gain them. We recommend recording a list of all the skills you might gain from the different steps of the character creation process, then making your choices at the end of that process rather than flipping back and forth through the book.

If you gain the same specific skill from two different sources (for instance, from a career and a class), you can pick a different skill from the same skill group. See Skills for more information.

## CHANGING CHARACTER OPTIONS

If you pick a skill, ability, class, or any other option that you end up not liking after using it in the game—even your character’s ancestry—you can always freely change that option between game sessions. If you want to change an option during a session, ask your Director. If they say it’s fine to swap that option out for something else, go for it.

## HEROIC ADVANCEMENT

Your character’s heroic advancement is marked by level. Each time you gain a new level in your class, your Stamina increases, and you gain new features or abilities according to your class’s advancement, as detailed in Classes.

In the standard setup for the game, heroes gain Experience each time they finish a respite. When you gain sufficient Experience, you gain a level during the same respite (see Building a Heroic Narrative). The Heroic Advancement table shows how much Experience (XP) you need to advance from one level to the next. The amount of Experience you gain is cumulative.

### HEROIC ADVANCEMENT TABLE

| XP      | Level |
|---------|-------|
| 0–9     | 1     |
| 10–24   | 2     |
| 25–39   | 3     |
| 40–54   | 4     |
| 55–69   | 5     |
| 70–84   | 6     |
| 85–99   | 7     |
| 100–114 | 8     |
| 115–129 | 9     |
| 130+    | 10    |

### ALTERNATIVE ADVANCEMENT

Though many games might advance using the standard setup for heroic advancement, the Director can decide that their game uses different advancement. Check with your Director to see what method of advancement they plan to use.

#### ADJUSTED XP ADVANCEMENT

Some Directors prefer that heroes level up faster or slower to suit the pace of their story. The Adjusted XP Advancement table is set up for campaigns where heroes advance at double or half the usual pace. Directors can also create their own customized pace for XP-based advancement.

| Level | XP for Double Speed | XP for Half Speed |
|-------|---------------------|------------------|
| 1     | 0–4                 | 0–19             |
| 2     | 5–12                | 20–49            |
| 3     | 13–20               | 50–79            |
| 4     | 21–28               | 80–109           |
| 5     | 29–36               | 110–139          |
| 6     | 37–43               | 140–169          |
| 7     | 44–51               | 170–199          |
| 8     | 52–58               | 200–229          |
| 9     | 59–65               | 230–259          |
| 10    | 66+                 | 260+             |

#### MILESTONE

Rather than tracking XP, some games see the heroes advance in level when they achieve a particular story milestone. For example, when a party defeats the main villain of an adventure and foils their dastardly plot, each hero gains a level for achieving this objective, no matter how many or few obstacles they faced along the way.

For many Directors using milestone advancement, the end of each adventure within a campaign serves as a milestone for leveling up. The Director can share these milestones with the players to encourage them to work toward particular goals, and to engage with the story and world the Director has prepared. For example, in a campaign where the heroes have to face nine evil mages, it makes sense that each time the heroes defeat a mage, they gain a level. The Director should keep milestone goals flexible, though. Defeating a mage could mean stopping them with violence, using negotiation to make them stand down, or anything else that thwarts their evil plans.

#### DIRECTOR SAYS SO

Some games don’t track XP or goals at all. The heroes simply gain a level whenever the Director decides it’s appropriate for the story.

# ANCESTRIES

Fantastic peoples inhabit the worlds of Draw Steel. Among them are devils, dwarves, elves, time raiders—even humans with their ability to sense the supernatural. Your hero is one of these folks! The fantastic ancestry you choose bestows benefits that come from your anatomy and physiology. This choice doesn’t grant you cultural benefits, like crafting or lore skills. While many game settings have cultures made of mostly one ancestry, other cultures and worlds have a cosmopolitan mix of peoples.

Ancestry describes how you were born. Culture (in the next chapter) describes how you grew up. If you want to be a wode elf who was raised in a forest among other wode elves, you can do that! If you want to play a wode elf who was raised in an underground city of dwarves, humans, and orcs, you can do that too!

## ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES

Orden is a fantasy world. It works on principles similar to those many people throughout history believed governed the real world. “I dunno, a god did it probably.” Humans, elves, orcs, dwarves, dragons, all have creator gods—the elder gods, four of whom made the world for some reason. Maybe they were bored.

The fashion among those gods for creating new, intelligent, species petered out after the orcs. Once humans came along and invented war, it stopped being fun.

It may be all species were created by gods. That’s certainly what a lot of people throughout our own history assumed. Orden has no Darwin and probably won’t ever. There’s still inheritance. People expect children to look like their parents, but there aren’t evolutionary pressures except on a very local scale.

And in a world where powerful, world-altering magics are available, mortals sometimes try to recreate the gods' efforts. Some succeed, and new intelligent, speaking peoples are born.

However, mortals are not gods and lack their ineffable wisdom. They are, in fact, very effable. Many have sought the power to create. It is available to any sorcerer of near-godlike power with the right rituals, though these days that power is very obscure. Creating new intelligent species was easier for mortal wizards back in the youth of the world when magic was friskier.

In every instance in recorded history, attempts by mortals to make obedient servitor species backfire. The steel dwarves worked marvels with valiar, the truemetal, and the miracle mineral iridoss, known as prismacore, that grants objects a semblance of life. Eventually, their science and magics produced the omnivok, machines that were self-aware. Perhaps uniquely, when the dwarves realized they had created beings equal to themselves they stopped their work and gave their creation full rights and independence, preferring to work with them rather than attempt, and inevitably fail, to be their masters.

Normally, it doesn’t work out that nicely. Even with the best of intentions, things go awry. The Dragon Phalanx were created by Good King Omund’s wizard Vitae to be the perfect knights, dispensing justice throughout the lands. But the same sorceries that grant self-awareness also grant independence. Agency. And though they enjoyed thirty years of peace and justice, eventually the dragon knights were betrayed by one of their own, seduced by the power offered by Ajax.

The law of unintended consequences applies to the just and the unjust alike.

Usually, when some powerful being tries to create an intelligent species, it’s for less than virtuous reasons. The synliroi are responsible for several intelligent species in the timescape, each an attempt to create a perfectly obedient servitor species. The most notorious example are the kuran’zoi, the time raiders who rebelled almost immediately and carry a burning hate for the voiceless talkers to this day.

A perhaps less egregious use of this power is called quickening. Used when a powerful mage lives in and amongst some clever species just on the cusp of self-awareness. These instances, which are much more numerous than creating a new species from whole cloth, are more like the concept of uplifting found in science fiction. The mage or witch or shaman didn’t create anything. They just gave these cute, clever, frog-things a little boost. A little nudge. And suddenly there are angualotls walking around having conversations with each other, wondering when someone will invent a fabric that doesn’t get moldy in the swamp.

This also carries serious ethical repercussions! “You didn’t create angulotls! You screwed up some perfectly good frogs! Look at them, you gave them anxiety!”

This is only how it works on Orden. You may have completely different explanations for why there are several different intelligent species walking around in your world. Or no explanation! Or competing and irreconcilable theories on the matter! Use whatever inspires you.

At the end of the day, if you throw out all of this and replace it with something you made up, it will be better. Because it’s yours!

## STARTING SIZE AND SPEED

Unless otherwise noted, a character from any of these ancestries is size 1M and has a speed of 5 and a stability of 0.

Where an ancestry provides you with an ability, see Abilities for details of the ability format.

## ANCESTRY TRAIT

Each ancestry has at least one signature trait, which your hero gets for free if they take the ancestry. This is a defining feature that other heroes of your ancestry also possess.

There are also purchased traits. You don’t get every purchased trait your ancestry has to offer. Instead, your ancestry details a budget of ancestry points you can use to...

purchase traits. Each trait has a point cost that you pay to grant the benefit to your hero.

For example, the devil ancestry has the signature trait **Silver Tongue** and 3 ancestry points to spend on seven different traits. A player creating a devil hero could buy **Barbed Tail**, **Big Horns**, and **Glowing Eyes**, which each cost 1 ancestry point, or they could buy one of those traits and purchase **Beast Legs** or **Wings**, which each cost 2 points. They couldn’t buy both **Beast Legs** and **Wings**, since their combined cost is 4, which is over the ancestry points budget for the devil.

## DEVIL

"Go to hell!"  
"You know, I have a rather interesting story about that..."

The native ancestry of the Seven Cities of Hell, devils are humanoids with red or blue skin expressed in a wide variety of hues, from bright crimson to deep purple. Each devil is born with some hellmark—horns, a tail, cloven hooves, a forked tongue, fanged incisors, or even wings. Hell is dominated by the Seven Cities of Hell, each ruled by a different archdevil who constantly plots and schemes against the others in the hope of ascending to the Throne of Hell.

Those devils who join "the trade," as their civil service is called, spend their days in bureaucratic service hoping or scheming for promotion. Devils looking for a quick path up the bureaucratic ladder sign up for the Exchange, whereby mortals in the mundane world who perform the right rituals can summon a devil, who bargains with the supplicant on behalf of their archdevil. Archdevils can grant temporary worldly power in exchange for a supplicant’s soul, with the summoned devil acting as the broker.

On rare occasions, though, the summoning goes wrong and the supplicant dies before the deal can be struck, stranding the summoned devil on Orden permanently. Some stranded devils seek to return to Hell, but most prefer life in Orden, where the phrase "stabbed in the back by a colleague" is usually a metaphor.

The majority of devils in Orden are not from, nor have ever been to, the Seven Cities. They are descendants of devils who were stranded in the mundane world decades, centuries, even millennia ago.

## ON DEVILS

Adelard scuttled across the floor of his basement, a heavy tome clutched in one hand, his index finger marking a page. Occasionally he would stop, open the book, consult a diagram, look at the chalk markings he’d made on the floor, tilt his head, then bend down and refine or rub out an esoteric symbol.

One of the red candles suddenly guttered out, making the small room noticeably darker. "Damn and blast!" he hissed. Then he relit it from another candle.

Stepping back to admire his handiwork, Adelard crossed his arms and nodded. He’d spent his last coppers on the candles—they weren’t cheap. And he feared the skull might be fake, but did it matter? The book just said *a skull*—it didn’t even specify *a human skull*! Did it matter if it was real? It was probably real. What kind of market was there for replica skulls? But it was awfully cheap. Anyway, did it matter? How would the ritual know if the skull was real?

He was wittering, putting off the inevitable. He pulled himself together. It was either going to work, or it wasn’t, and wittering wasn’t going to help. He opened the book and turned the page—then began to speak the ritual.

Moments later, the candles flared, there was a burst of flame, and acrid brimstone filled his nostrils. When the smoke cleared... there was a devil standing in his basement—dark purple skin, horns, even a twitching tail.

"Aha! Yes, finally." It rubbed its hands together. "It’s about time," the creature said, pulling on the bottom of his waistcoat to straighten it. "Now then! How does it go? Oh, yes." He cleared his throat. "On behalf of my lord, his grace Archduke Dispater, Lord of Dis, I am empowered to offer you..." But his speech fell on deaf ears.

"It worked!" Adelard said, holding his clenched fists up. "Ahahaha! It worked! Finally, after years! I will have my revenge! Hahaha...!" *cough* *cough* Adelard was suddenly gripped by a coughing fit, but he kept crowing.

"Dismiss me from service, will they?! *cough* Old and useless... am I?! I’ll show them!" He coughed again, fighting to breathe now. "I will hex them and torture them until they..."

He stopped cavorting and capering, and his eyes went wide. "Until they... until..." He clutched his chest.

"Uh-oh," the devil said, genuinely worried.

"HNNG!" Adelard grunted. Then he collapsed to the ground, curled into a fetal position, obviously in immense pain.

"No, no. Nurse!" the devil called out. "Doctor!? Is anyone... you should lie down. Well, you are lying down. Do some... some deep-breathing exercises. Have a cup of tea! That always..."

Adelard gasped one last time and uncurled, muscles relaxed. Eyes open but unseeing.

"... calms me down," the devil said quietly.

Suddenly, the candles were extinguished as one, plunging the room into pitch-blackness. The devil’s hellsight meant this was only a minor inconvenience for him. "Um," he said to the empty room. "Uh-oh."

He poked the tip of his boot at the chalk symbol surrounding him on the floor. Nothing happened. He stepped on it. Nothing happened. He put his weight on that foot. No alarms went off.

He walked out of the circle. Nothing happened. No one, it seemed, cared.

A few moments later, the door to a small home, little more than a wooden shack, on the outskirts of a small village opened. A well-dressed devil peeked out and then slowly emerged, stepping onto the dirt road that led through the center of the village. A keep stood atop a hill in the distance.
"Ah," the devil said.

A wide woman dressed in wool, carrying a pile of clean clothes, saw him and stopped in her tracks, her mouth open.

"Oh! Good day to you madam, I wonder if you could tell me..."

"AAAHHHHH!!!" she screamed. For quite a long time. Then she dropped her laundry and ran.

"Ah. Um. Hmm."

A young man in a low, stone building saw this exchange, grabbed what looked like a long iron poker, and ran out to confront the new arrival.

"Have at you, devil!" he said, assuming something like a dueling pose.

"I say! Steady on!" The devil raised his hands.

The two of them stood there, frozen in the middle of the street for a few moments.

Then the devil turned and ran away as quickly as he could.

---

"And that’s how I ended up here!" Riyalkin toasted his dinner companion. "Now, after years of obscurity, a legendary hero!"

"Legendarily vain," his dinner guest teased with a smile.

"Simply playing my part, darling. People expect a certain amount of vanity in a troubadour, don’t they?"

She laughed. "Riyalkin the Red Pen is every bit as advertised."

"Thank you. And besides, accusations of vanity are a bit rich coming from my leading lady."

"Not all actors are vain." She took offense beautifully. "Just the good ones." She sipped her drink.

"Well then, you must be very vain indeed," the devil said. "Anyway, does that answer your question?"

"Mostly. Do they speak Caelian in hell?"

"What a good question. Unless it’s very old, the ritual usually grants knowledge of the summoner’s language. I gather in the bad old days, we used to just show up in a cloud of brimstone and gabble at people. I’m sure it was impressive, but what did it achieve? Not very professional, I can tell you that."

"No cloud of brimstone now?" she teased.

He waggled his eyebrows. "Style counts for something."

"But wait, that was..." She did some quick mental math. "Fifteen years ago?"

"Well, I was an accountant here in Capital for several years in between."

"An accountant!"

Riyalkin shrugged. "It’s what I did before. I’m moderately good at it."

"And how does one go from being an alien accountant to a famous troubadour?"

"Well..." Riyalkin seemed uncomfortable suddenly. "It’s just that... the thing is, accountancy in the Seven Cities is just so much more interesting than it is here. Plotting and scheming, always on the lookout for an assassin, people constantly trying to claw their way up the ladder, usually over your dead body. And I guess I just... missed the excitement."

"The excitement of being an accountant."

"The excitement of being an accountant in Hell," Riyalkin said. "In any event, enough about me and the thrill of double-entry bookkeeping. Perhaps you can enlighten me. Why is it, in spite of my impeccable taste and the outrageous sums I spend looking good, I always feel underdressed in your presence? Do you employ sorcery? Or is it that any outfit is improved by your unearthly beauty?"

She blushed in spite of herself and raised her own glass in a toast.

"You silver-tongued devil."

## DRAGON KNIGHT

"I thought the dragon knights would save us, but even they couldn’t stop Ajax. Now the roads aren’t safe. People are taken from their homes without cause or warning, never to return. I don’t know what’s going to happen now, except everyone’s afraid all the time.

"I think things are going to get a lot worse before they get better."

The Ritual of Dracogenesis that grants the power to create a generation of dragon knights—also known as draconians or wyrmwights—is obscure and supremely difficult for even an experienced sorcerer to master. Small populations of draconians in Khemhara, Higara, and Khorshir attest to this. Descendants of original generations created millennia ago by powerful wizards, they have never been numerous. A typical clutch yields only a single egg. After only a few generations, these draconians begin to show new adaptations like feathers or frilled ridges.

The largest extant population of draconians is the remnants of the Dragon Phalanx in Vasloria. Created by Good King Omund’s wizard Vitae, the Dragon Phalanx once numbered several thousand of the king’s greatest knights, ensuring the rule of law across the land.

Knighthood was a title carried by every member of that first generation of dragon knights. Within the Dragon Phalanx were shadows, censors, tacticians, and elementalists. Members of virtually every heroic vocation could be found in one of the eight dragonflights that made up the phalanx. For over thirty years, these heroes were symbols of justice, protecting the weak from the strong, and standing between the common folk and those who sought power over others. Those who grew up in that place and time could never have imagined any other way of life.

Then Ajax came.

### ON THE DRAGON KNIGHTS

The cloaked figure at the back of the inn stood up. As they did so, their hood slipped down, revealing their head and face. A susurration rippled through the crowd. One man standing near the bar dropped his jaw, followed by his flagon of mead.

A tall, broad draconian stepped into the light. He was old, his scales battle-scarred. He rested one clawed hand on the pommel of a mace that hung from a loop on his belt, while the other carried his shield by a strap. His flat, expressionless look was more terrifying than any threatening glower.

The three human bandits took a step back. One of the dwarves just sneered—then, sensing his human compatriot’s reluctance, turned to look at them. "What’s this?" the lead dwarf growled.

"Don’t be cowards now!" the other dwarf said, a hint of joy in his voice. "Look what a prize we have caught!"

"We didn’t..." one bandit said, shaking. "We didn’t know..."

Looking at the dragon knight, the other bandit added quickly, "We didn’t know there was one of you here."

The draconian didn’t move. Didn’t give any indication he heard the man. Just stared unblinking at the lead dwarf.

"Think of the bounty," the dwarf hissed to the humans, but he kept his eye on the draconian. "We’ll all be rich."

"I don’t..." One of the bandits dropped her sword and held her hands up as she backed away from the group toward the exit. "I don’t need it that bad," she said. Then she turned and ran out the door. Her human compatriots followed.

The two dwarves surveyed the tavern. The people were now all facing them. A few had stood up. They weren’t afraid anymore.

"We’ll be back," the lead dwarf said, and the two of them backed out of the inn, sheathing their shortswords before they turned and left.

As one, the people in the tavern turned to look with undisguised awe at the dragon knight. He noticed this, ducked his head to avoid their gaze. "Show’s over," he growled, then he turned to go back to his seat in the rear.

"Thank you," the woman behind the bar said. "Thank you for..." She stopped when she saw the draconian was ignoring her.

A short, doughty, middle-aged man stood up, and two equally doughty women at the same table stood up with him. "Excuse me, sir knight," the man said as the dragon knight walked past their table.

The knight moved on, ignoring them. The man reached out and grabbed the massive draconian’s arm. The knight wheeled on the peasant, looming over him.

The man bowed his head and touched his forelock. The two women with him curtseyed and tried to avoid making eye contact.

"Begging your pardon, sir, but we been lookin’ for you."

The dragon knight sneered and bared a set of sharp teeth. "Look for someone else," he growled as he pulled his arm away.

The man scurried around to stand in front of the draconian, blocking his way. He took off his worn cap and held it over his breast. "I’m sorry sir, but there ain’t no one else. And there’s this new tax, you see, from the new baron. And a priest says he’s of Saint Ajax."

The knight bared his impressive teeth, ready to scare Jago and the other two away—when someone else spoke.

"You might want to hear 'em out, Vaant," said a voice from the table the three peasants had been sitting at.

The dragon knight turned sharply to look at the man who’d spoken. His back was to the draconian, but the voice gave him away.

"John?"

The man turned to look up.

"Hi Vaant," he said, smiling. He rose from the table. He was middle-aged, fit. Black hair hung down to his shoulders. He was armed with many weapons, looked like a captain of the guard. "Folks," he said, "this is Vaantikalisax, Knight of King Omund in the Thunder Phalanx. He may be the last of the Storm Knights."

The man held out his hand. The dragon knight looked at it for a moment before reaching out slowly to grasp it. "What are you doing out here?" Vaantikalisax asked.

"These people need help. I said I’d find it. Heard a rumor someone matching your description was holed up here having a drinking contest with Mr. John Barleycorn."

The draconian sniffed, released John’s hand, and looked at the three peasants. "Why do you people need me? You’re in the company of Sir John, Commander of the Fifth..."

"Just John," Sir John said, holding a hand up. "The new baron stripped me of my title. My lands."

"I didn’t know that." The draconian’s voice softened. "I’m sorry."

"I’ll be fine. But these people..." John said, gesturing to the three older peasants. Vaantikalisax waved him to silence.

"Sure," he said. "But why me?"

"Thought maybe you’d like to get back in the game."

"The game."

"Yeah." Sir John smiled. "The hero game."

Vaantikalisax said nothing. The inn had mostly gone back to its business but the three peasants watched intently. Eventually, the dragon knight spoke again, his voice low.

"I owe you a lot, John—but not everything."

"I’m not asking everything."

"No, that’s not how it starts. But I have this feeling that’s how it’ll end."

"What does your oath say? 'Even should the sun stop in the sky, even should the night—'"

"John," the dragon knight said, his voice suddenly sad. Exasperated. "You don’t want to quote my oath to me. You really don’t. I liked serving with you. I have fond memories of that time—of you. Don’t spoil it." He looked at his friend, the three peasants, then shook his head and turned to leave the inn.

"Vaant," Sir John said, following. "Sir Vaantikalisax, by your oath!"

The dragon knight stopped and spun around. Everyone in the inn was watching the show again. Act two.

"The people need leadership," John said as he looked at all the folk watching.

Vaantikalisax’s reptile eyes flashed in anger. "They had it! Thirty years, and what did it amount to?! I watched Ajax... I watched him..." The dragon knight’s eyes flinched. His clawed hands tightened on his mace and shield. "I watched the oath... fail."

"Vaant... Vaant, the Dragon Phalanx didn’t fail. You were betrayed. It was Mandrake! One of your own, don’t you get it? You’re just as fallible as the rest of us. You were never 'incorruptible.' It’s just what we wanted to believe. You’re just people—like the rest of us."

The dragon knight looked at the people around him, at the three peasants desperate for someone, anyone, to help them. Then he looked back to his friend.

"Exactly," Vaantikalisax said. Then he turned and left the inn.

## DWARF

"Remember, we are dwarves. Our strength is the strength of the earth. The strength of the marble column that rises to the heavens. The strength of the granite foundation that reaches deep into the ground. But what is the value of strength if it is not used in service of justice?"  
—Zarok the Lawgiver, Hero, Dwarves 232

Possessed of a strength that belies their size, dwarves have flesh infused with stone—a silico-organic hybrid making them physically denser than other humanoids. They enjoy a reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings, the long-extinct steel dwarves.

Dwarves are the children of the elder god Ord, and a common phrase among dwarves is “Ord made the world”—their way of saying, “What will be, will be.” They take great pride in knowing that along with Aan, Eth, and Kul, their god created the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see the world and seek glory in Ord’s name.

### ON DWARVES

There’s nothing a team of dwarves can’t do! Five dwarves alone can easily kill a dragon. Ten dragons!  
Why, Vorka the Fell-Handed alone slew five dragons at the Siege of Var Loska before succumbing to her wounds. One dwarf! Think what a small, dedicated party of dwarves could do! There aren’t many of the great dragons left, alas, so we must… I mean, dwarves must content themselves with fighting lesser evils. Necromancers, tyrants. Folks who cheat at dice.

Dwarves take the long view. Well, so do elves, but elves seem more interested in preserving things. Dwarves want to make things! Improve the world! “The world is fine the way it is…” Shut up! No it’s not! The world is full of pain, misery, injustice. We cannot make a perfect world, but we can strive to improve the one we’ve got!

Anyway. Humans make too much of this so-called rivalry between dwarves and elves. Yes, it was an elf army that slew the last steel dwarves in the War Against Night, but that was tens of thousands of years ago. And anyway, those were the shadow elves, long banished to the World Below. And none now live who remember those days.

The steel dwarves—the greatest of us—are dead now, and our cousins the fire dwarves left this world for Quintessence long ago. There they built Alloy, the City of Brass, the City at the Center of the Timescape. A marvel! Not so large as Capital, perhaps, but not so… fragrant either.

It is left to us, the stone dwarves, the Last Children of Ord, to work stone, create great marvels with it. Our greatest days are not behind us! Who speaks thus!? Have we not been to the Hanging City of Kal Kalavar together? Will you ever forget that place? I will not should I live to be a thousand, and neither will you. And it was finished in my lifetime. Only three hundred years ago! It’s brand new!

Elven rivalry. Pagh! Did we not name the most precious metal in the earth “valiar” after their god Val? Val is a noble god, a worthy patron of the elves. He seeks justice and glory in his own way, we deem. Were one to choose the path of the conduit, you could pick worse gods than Val to serve.

It is the humans who make so much of rivalries between the ancestries. It was the humans who called us “dwarves.” We do not know the significance of this word in their tongue, but we accept it. Their speech is crude, true, but they are a young species after all. We must not judge them too harshly. “Elemental” would be a faithful translation of our word for ourselves into the Caelian tongue.

Ah, the record of dwarven achievement is long… too long to tell in so short a space. And it is not seemly to compare ourselves so. This entry spends many words on elves and…

*This is what happens when you let a dwarven troubadour write the dwarf entry.*

...men as though we were competitors, but who says it? Why should it be thus? Was it a dwarf who slew Baalorak the Griefbringer? No! It was the Crown of Nine Stars! That legendary company of heroes who counted three dwarves among their number, but also elves and orcs and humans. Like the great cosmopolitan city of Alloy, we are stronger together.

Look you again at the Hanging City. Yes, your eyes well with tears from the magnificence of it, but see it clearly. Is it a dwarven city? Everyone calls it thus, but do you know how many humans live there? Thousands. And orcs. And elves! Of course! How else should it be?

Some say the greatest ages of the world are behind us, but this is not so. Not so. While there is yet will in the world, there is greatness. You will see. The elves, the orcs. Humans and dwarves. All the speaking peoples have wonder in them yet. Our greatest days are ahead. Did not Ord make the world?

None of us ask to come into this world, and apart from the Hakaan, none of us know how we will leave it. But remember, you are a dwarf. You have it in you to work marvels. To change the world, be you a holy conduit of Valak-koth the Peacebringer, one of the talented Mind Masters of the White Gem, a beastheart of the Darkdivers seeking through the World Below for deep knowledge, or a master tactician of the Imperial War College in Capital. You will make a better world.

You are young yet, but already those who work evil deeds should fear you. You are a dwarf. You have a great destiny ahead.

## DWARF TRAITS

Dwarf heroes have access to the following traits.

### SIGNATURE TRAIT: RUNIC CARVING

You can carve a magic rune onto your skin. The rune you carve determines the benefit you receive. You can change or remove this rune with 10 minutes of work while not engaged in combat.

- **Detection:** Pick a specific type of creature, such as "goblins" or "humans" or an object, such as "magic swords" or "potions." Your rune glows softly when you are within 20 squares of a chosen creature or object, regardless of line of effect. You can change the type of creature as a maneuver.

## ELF, WODE

*See you the wood so dark and deep,  
Where runs the fox and hare?  
You know now why your mother weeps.  
Your father’s bones lie there.  
See you the river clear and sweet  
So beautiful and fair?  
Follow it in and you may meet  
The Queen of Dark and Air*

Children of the sylvan celestials and masters of the elf-haunted forests called wodes, wode elves see all forests as their domain by birthright. They know and enjoy their reputation among humans for snatching children who wander too far into the woods. Humans should fear the trees.

The wode elves’ natural ability to mask their presence, called glamor, complements their guerrilla style of fighting, letting them strike quickly from cover and then meld back into the underbrush. These traits also make the relatively few wode elves who dwell in cities naturally adept at urban warfare.

### ON WODE ELVES

"I’m scared," Wenna said. "We should go back." The forest felt as if it was closing in on them.

"We’re not going back," Jeremy said. Normally, such a statement would be the end of the discussion, but they were alone and far from home.

"What if we’re going in circles?"

"Then we keep going in circles!" Dade said from somewhere up ahead. "Until we find the elves."

"The elves have found you!" a clear, bright voice called out. The children froze. They scanned the wood, but there were no signs of the speaker.

Then, only a few feet from them, a half-dozen figures melded out of the background, as if the trees and bushes and grass had been painted on them to perfectly match the wode. They wore light armor covered in leaves, moss, and vines, and they bristled with weapons.

"Black gods!" Meliora gasped. Credan frowned, and Wenna hushed her for swearing. Dade was ushered back toward them by two more wode elves, his bow in hand. The children huddled together, Credan’s hand on the symbol of Saint Gryffyn around his neck, and Jeremy’s hand on the hilt of his sword.

The elves were tall, taller than an adult human, but seemed always to crouch as soon as they stopped moving. Their eyes were unsettling, widely spaced, and huge. But it was their ears, long and tall and twisting and set with great scoops to catch all sound, that marked them as elves of the wode.

"Admittedly, though, most terrans regret the experience." The voice they had heard called out again—from above. The children looked up and now saw a wode elf with long, furry, twisting ears and nut-brown skin smiling down at them. They were wearing a brightly colored outfit. The children watched the elf leap lightly from branch to lower branch until finally landing with a flourish on the forest floor before them.

"Consort!" An elf before them spoke in Yllyric as he stood from his crouch and bowed. "We have been tracking these since they entered the wode."

Meliora, who understood the words, whispered to the others. "They called that one 'consort!'"

Llyander smiled, looking from Meliora to the elf who had just addressed them with a *See? I told you!* look on their face.

The tall, swashbuckling elf bowed to the children. "I am Llyander, the Lightning Strike, Consort to Queen Imyrr." They indicated the elf who had spoken. "This is my cousin, Rhythylthin."

"How did you know we were here?" Jeremy asked. Dade stood just behind him, with an arrow now nocked.

The one called Rhythylthin reached out while Dade was turned, looking at the queen’s consort, and deftly plucked the arrow from the young man’s bow.

"Nothing happens within the wode without our knowledge," the elf said. Dade spun on him and nocked another arrow. "And approval," Rhythylthin added, closing his hand and snapping the arrow in it.

"You come bearing a gift for our queen—the Codex Dryadalis." Llyander nodded at the heavy scroll Meliora carried. "My cousin Rhythylthin here was sent to capture you and escort you to the Orchid Court. But I am the queen’s consort, and have my own thoughts on the matter." The elf smiled at the children. "But have no fear," they said. Their Vaslorian was perfect, their voice a song. "You are safe … now." The pause before "now" spoke volumes.

"Are you a … a … boy or a girl?" Wenna asked.

Llyander smiled gaily. "I am a song! I contain melodies and harmonies alike," they said. Wenna smiled. Rhythylthin rolled his eyes. Llyander noticed this and winked at him. "Fashions change. My cousin here wears the new trends." They gestured at the other wode elf’s garb and masculine appearance. "Me? I’m old fashioned." They gestured to their own outfit and appearance. "Grace never goes out of style."

Llyander turned to Rhythylthin and the rest of the wode elf band. "Their gift goes to Lord Tear, methinks. I will escort them." Then, suddenly imperious, they added, "You may go."

In spite of his previous skepticism toward the queen’s consort, Rhythylthin straightened and bowed. As one, the elves turned and flowed into the wode. In only a few steps, they melded into the trees and undergrowth.

"How did they do that?" Meliora demanded, spinning to confront their benefactor.

"Hmm? Do what?" Llyander asked, looking after the elves, wondering what Meliora meant.

"Just … disappear like that!"

Llyander looked at the other children with a combination of wonder and annoyance. "Do terran children not play hiding games?"

"Well …" Jeremy looked at Dade, who was no help. "We do, but …"

Llyander made a theatrical, dismissive gesture with one arm. "Well, it is the same thing, then. But for our people, it is a game we practice all our lives! We would be poor protectors of the wode if we could not conceal ourselves within it."

"But that was …" Meliora was frustrated at the elf’s seeming evasion. "That was magic!"

"You say? Well," Llyander mused, "terrans are a part and apart, it is said. It is your blessing and your curse methinks. Perhaps someday you can explain it to me!" The elf’s eyes twinkled at Meliora’s frustration.

Llyander turned and marched off. "Come!" they called. The children ran to catch up.

"Where are we going?" Wenna asked.

"I enjoy the favor of Lord Tear," Llyander said. "We are old friends. With me as your guide, he will treat you well—likely bestow favor upon you! You should be in anticipation of great treasure." They smiled.

The elf stopped suddenly and spun toward them, serious but kindly. They pointed to each of the children in turn. "I will instruct you on the proper etiquette, but remember this: Lord Tear will test us. Some tests for you and some for me. The high elves and the wode elves are but distant cousins. You will hear much that is polite, much that is flattering, but it is all another kind of glamor. It hides deep tensions, recently exacerbated by the treaty with Ajax."

The children nodded. The elf, satisfied, marched off and they followed.

Jeremy turned to Dade. "I feel like we’re in a dream," he whispered.
"You are!" their escort called out. "The wode is a dream! With a little luck, one you may soon wake safely from."

## ELF, HIGH

"Ajax has a kind of crude style, perhaps, but no taste. I have no objection to a villain, you understand. The world is a tale, but a tale is only as good as its villain. And Ajax is so … artless. We deserve a better villain."

Children of the solar celestials created to tend their libraries and attend to the true elves as heralds, the high elves remember a better age, before the coming of humans and war. A time when the celestials were still in the world, and all that mattered was art and beauty.

In the millennia since their creators retired to Arcadia, the high elves built a civilization for themselves, primarily living in and among the fallen celestial sky cities. With no creators left to please, the elves continue as they did before—collecting lore and knowledge, worshiping art, and turning more inward and distrusting of outsiders with each generation.

### ON HIGH ELVES

"They’re so beautiful," Wenna said. "It’s hard to imagine we’re in danger."

"It’s not that hard," Dade said darkly.

The five children stood alone in the center of a large circular courtyard open to the sky, their wode elf escort Llyander at their side. Lord Tear, King of the High Elves, sat on a marble throne, holding the scroll of the Codex Dryadalis in his lap. He had not spoken since Llyander made their speech and handed the codex over. The members of the court, nobles and courtiers and learned sages, gathered to watch. Implacable warriors in golden plate with fine filigree etched into the metal stood guard around the perimeter. They bristled with weapons.

"They seem like …" Meliora said, searching for the words.

"Like the lords of all the world," Wenna said with awe and wonder.

"And we are their prisoners," Jeremy said, looking at his brother Dade and Credan beside him.

"You’re not prisoners," Llyander said quietly. "You are guests. You’re safer here than you would be even in your own homes."

"Yes," Jeremy said, looking at the nearest guards with their longspears and swords. "We feel very safe."

"Who are you kidding?" Dade said. "Everyone knows how much elves hate humans."

At this, Lord Tear exchanged a look with Llyander, consort to Queen Imyrr. It was a knowing look, full of sadness and melancholy. Then he broke his silence.

"Show me an elf who hates humans," he said, his voice deep and sonorous, "and I will show you an elf who loved a human and watched them grow old and die." He looked at the children for the first time and smiled a melancholy smile. "Love is like sunlight for us, you see. We love completely but rarely. The loss of it means an eternity of grief for us."

The king tapped the scroll against his lap, seeming to have reached a decision.

"Well done, consort. Young humans, your escort here seeks to shame me. For they know well they could have taken this prize to their queen and earned her favor. Instead, Llyander brought it to me in the hopes that by doing so, they deliver me the power necessary to throw off the yoke of Ajax’s rule. Long has Llyander resented the decision I made and sought to change it …"—he looked at Llyander—"… by changing my mind."

Llyander nodded deferentially, silently congratulating the king on his insight.

"Alas, your escort’s efforts are for naught." Then the king’s face became softer. He held up the heavy scroll. "But this is not nothing," he said. "We made a treaty with Ajax to deliver unto him any artifacts our search teams discover from the ruins of this city. He benefits from this bargain more than we. But this, methinks, will stay with us. It was written by my mother in the youth of the world, and there are some things which must be denied the Iron Saint, even should they violate the treaty."

Llyander turned to the children and smiled brilliantly, eyebrows waggling in a show of glee. Wenna and Credan couldn’t help but smile. "Well, you see children?" Llyander said. "We only have more to do, not everything to do."

The king stood up, and a herald beside the throne announced, "Gather ye, and attend! The Lord of Fallen Irranys, Morning Dew On a Single Leaf Like a Tear from the Sun, speaks. And know his word is law!"

Lord Tear glided down the steps until he was standing, as tall as Llyander, before the children. His face was noble and beautiful. Wisps of silver-like strands of smoke spread across his golden skin. He seemed at once eternal and youthful.

"You have heard many things about my people, but this above all you should know. We do not value lore for lore’s sake, but beauty first and above all other things. And the truth, to us, is a kind of beauty. Thus do we find knowledge beautiful.

"You have returned something not only of enormous worldpower, but at the same time, a work of art my mother labored over for many of your centuries. It is something of a miracle that it is returned to me now. I will not forget this. You have made an ally of the lord of the high elves. And though you lead brief lives, while you live, you shall have the favor of the elves." He turned to hand the scroll over to a sage and confer with his herald.

"He seems wise," Credan said.

"And smart," Meliora said.

"I’m surprised how kind he is," Jeremy said. "He seems a good king."

Llyander chuckled. Wenna noticed. She didn’t say anything at first, but eventually she couldn’t resist. "What?"

Llyander raised an eyebrow, then walked in front of the children so that as the wode elf spoke, their back was to the king.

"Do you remember when my cousin’s soldiers hid in the wode?" they said, their voice low. "How astonished you were?"

Wenna and Meliora nodded. Llyander nodded to the guards and guests. "This is their glamor. Whatever you find pleasant and attractive in another? That is what you see in them. If you value good humor, they are jesters. If you value beauty, they are breathtaking. If you find intelligence attractive, they are sages. It is not just an effect of appearance, though it is also that. It is one of demeanor."

"But how do they do …"

Llyander put a finger to their lips, silencing young Meliora. "It is not a thing they do. It is an effect in your mind."

"You mean they don’t even know they’re doing it?" Meliora asked.

"Then what do they really look like?" Wenna asked.

Llyander shrugged. "What does anyone really look like?"

And while the other children chalked this up to their escort’s normally abstruse mode of communication, Meliora caught a glimpse of understanding somewhere in her mind.

The king turned back to them. "Should any of you seek hidden lore or deep wisdom, please allow me to serve you first. But you, young woman, the human child who learned our language, I name thee elf friend. And my naming carries power. You will find the learning of our lore will come more quickly to you, and all those who still revere the elves will give you safe passage in their lands."

Llyander put their hands on their hips and regarded the children. "Not bad for your second quest. What shall you do for an encore?"

## HAKAAN

Defending the Society’s flank, the Pillar stood alone against the Bloodstone Legion. The Arrow was awestruck and afraid. She was a different person in a fight.

"COME FORTH, SONS OF ORD!" the hakaan metamorph bellowed as Ajax’s dwarven legion advanced. "AND MEET A BETTER WOMAN THAN THEE!!"

"You … you know when you’re going to die?"

The Pillar, dressed in her civilian clothing—a simple pleated dress cinched at the waist that left her bare arms free to work—dipped her hand in the pail of water. It immediately sprang to life, the water sizzled and danced as her fingers cooled. She pulled her hand out, shook off the water, and went back to sculpting the granite.

The hard, tough stone melded like clay under her fingers. Whatever she was doing, it generated enormous heat in her fingertips, hence the pails of water beside her. The Arrow couldn’t tell if this was her talent manifest, or something her people could do, or neither. As he watched, he realized he recognized the bust. It was the girl they rescued during the Society’s recent battle with the Academy. (See last ish. -MC.)

"Not exactly," the Pillar said as she concentrated on her art. "Not when. More sort of …" She looked away from her sculpture and looked out the window, thinking. "How. Why. I am told there is a sense of …" She looked at the young man, a teenager, only recently recruited to the Society. "Anticipation. Eagerness when the time is nigh. So," she took in a deep breath, which was an impressive sight to see in a 9-foot-tall woman, and let it out, smiling at the young man. "Not anytime soon." Her smile was like a sunrise.

Though he had lived with fear most of his young life, mortality was not something that plagued the Arrow’s mind. He had a hard time grasping it. "That must be … awful."

"Oh no," she went back to her work. "No it’s … I do not know how to say it in Caelian. It is a blessing. I have seen people die for no reason. Be taken from their loved ones without warning, without … without purpose. There are unjust deaths. They destroy families. Communities.

"But the doomsight only comes in time of great need. People forget Holkatya is also the goddess of luck, and those who beat luck—under … underdogs, as you say. She gave more than she stole, I sometimes think.

"I do not know how long I have. No one does, but I know my death will have meaning. I know it, do you understand? I know it like I know my own name. Often I feel …" Her great hands clenched and unclenched, as though she were trying to grasp something just out of reach. "I yearn for it. I want it to happen. What greater end can there be than fulfilling one’s destiny?" She looked at the mostly-finished sculpture. "It gives everything I do a sense of purpose." She went back to work.

"My people are a serene and peaceful lot. We do not seek glory like the folk of Vanigar. But, in battle sometimes, knowing I am getting closer to my wyrd, my destiny, I think I know how they feel. Something comes over me, some enormous sense of … of rightness." She smiled again at the young man. "It scares my friends sometimes, I know."

The Arrow had seen it, and enthusiastically agreed.

"You’re not from the Barrow Hills," he said.

The Pillar shook her head, "No, I do not wot of your hills. I am from the hills north of the Blue Cloud Mountains in far Vanigar." She turned and looked down at the Arrow with some pride. "My people are descended from the original Haka’an tribe." She went back to work. "Though I am sure the Barrow Men, as you call them, are a fine people. We’re all related, you see."

"Is that why you joined the Society?"

"Oh yes," the Pillar said. "I had only left home a fortnight previous when Memory came to Vanigar to recruit me. I had a sense my wyrd lay in some distant land, but I did not know the world was so big."

"Did she look like herself?" the Arrow asked, smiling. Enjoying a moment of shared experience with the giant woman.

The Pillar chuckled, and the Arrow’s chest vibrated with the force of it. "No, she looked like an agéd wise woman of Vanigar. I think only in fabled Alloy could the Memory of a Sunset at Dawn walk the streets without ‘scaring the horses,’ as they say."

"Alloy?"

The Pillar looked at the Arrow out of the corner of her eye. "You’ll see," she said with some glee.

"You were following your vision, you said."

"Yes, my wyrd as the Vanigair call it."

"What did you see?"

"Oh," she smiled and blushed, "it is not meet to say."

"It’s bad luck?"

"Mmmm … you would say maybe. I think … rude is closer, but the doomsight is rarely clear in any event. It is full of symbolism and metaphor. My father is the shaa'er of our tribe. The skald as the Vanigair call it. He thought the symbolism was a kind of protection. So that I might know with certainty the meaning, but be unable to clearly convey it to others." She nodded. "I think he is right."

"Is it like a dream or a nightmare?" The Arrow wasn’t sure how much it was okay to ask.

"No, it was not a dream, it was a thing that happened." She turned to face the Arrow and leaned her massive arms on her legs. "I know not how it is for other doomseekers, but this is how it was for me. I was collecting flecks of jasper, a … a mineral we add to our food. I was picking flakes of rock up off the ground when I saw a bee that could not fly and a horde of ants all around, one with wings. In that moment, that was all that I could see. It was like the rest of the world fell away, and the bee and the ants filled my sight. Though the bee was surrounded and the ants seemed to go on forever, I could see the ants were afraid. There were dozens of dead ants on the ground."

"What did you do?"

"Mm?" The Pillar was lost for a moment, remembering the moment.

"What happened next?"

The Pillar shrugged, giant muscles in her shoulders rippling. "That was the end of my vision. At that moment, I knew I had to leave home."

"Wow."

"Indeed. Its meaning is clear to me. I stand alone against the endless horde. In my heart, they are Ajax’s war dogs. I think I know this, but …" She shrugged again.

"But how come you’re alone? Where am I? Where’s the Society?"

"Who knows?" she smiled. "When the vision comes upon you, it is all you can see. Maybe it is like a painting, and I am the painter. And if only I could turn my head a little ways to the left or right, I would see my friends there, fighting with me. I like to think mine is a great sacrifice, made so my friends can escape some overwhelming evil. It is a common theme among the fated I am told."

"What about the bee? What happened to the bee?"

"Oh, feeling sorry for it, I placed my finger gently on the ground, and you must see," she held up her pinky, "even my little finger is like a mighty wall for the bee. I sought only to protect it from the ants, but it quickly scrambled onto my finger, and after I stood up, it cleaned itself and flew away."

"It could fly!" the Arrow said, suddenly full of youthful exuberance. "It could fly the entire time! It was just waiting … for someone else to come along."

The Arrow stared, wide-eyed at the Pillar. Even before the young man spoke, the hakaan talent’s eyes widened in realization. "My vision …" she said.

"Wasn’t over!" the Arrow said, his joy impossible to hide.

### HAKAAN TRAITS

Hakaan heroes have access to the following traits.

**Signature Trait: Big!**

Your size is 1L.

**Purchased Hakaan Traits**

You have 3 ancestry points to spend on the following traits:

- **All is a Feather (Costs 1 Point)**: You are exceptionally strong and have an edge made on tests that use the Lift skill.
- **Forceful (Costs 1 Point)**: When you force move a creature or object, you can increase the distance moved by 1.
- **Stand Tough (Costs 1 Point)**: Your body is made to withstand the blows of your enemies. Your Might score counts as 1 higher for resisting potencies.
- **Great Fortitude (Costs 2 Points)**: Your hearty constitution prevents you from losing strength. You can’t be weakened.
- **Doomsight (Costs 2 Points)**: Working with your Director, you can predetermine an encounter in which you will die. When that encounter begins, you become doomed. While doomed, you lose the Undaunted benefit from this ancestry, you automatically get tier 3 results on tests and resistance rolls, and you don’t die no matter how low your Stamina falls. You then die immediately at the end of the encounter.

  If you don’t predetermine your death encounter, you can choose to become doomed while you are dying with the Director’s approval (no action required). Doing so should be reserved for encounters in which you are dying as a result of suitable heroism, such as making a last stand against a boss or saving civilians, or when the consequences of your actions have finally caught up to you—not because you’re playing a one-shot and have nothing to lose, Hacaarl.

  Additionally, when your Stamina equals the negative of your winded value and you are not doomed, you turn to rubble instead of experiencing death. You are unaware of your surroundings in this state. After 12 hours, you regain Stamina equal to your Recovery value.
  
## HUMAN

"Humans," the dwarf said with a combination of exasperation and awe. "Their only virtue seems to be believing in impossible things."

"Humans belong to the world in a way the other speaking peoples do not. You can sense the presence of magic—that … oily smell in the air, as I’ve heard it described. And the presence of deathless causes the hairs on the back of your neck to stand up. Or why do you think graveyards affect you so? Whatever magic is, its grip on you is light. Whatever drives the deathless, your nature rebels against it.

"No one knows why this should be. We elves have no such senses. Nor do the elementals or the kanin … the dwarves and the orcs as you say. What is it that sets humans apart? I am a historian, not a physician. I cannot say. Perhaps some of you will one day find out and teach us all the reason."

### ON HUMANS

So, we arrive here at the end of your first semester of Human Culture. I hope to see you next year in the Caelian Empire course, and though it may be hard to believe now, I often see former students’ names in our textbooks years later. Perhaps that will be some of you.

I will now answer the one question I am asked most often, and which I save answering until the last day of class. What do I think of humans?

I am a high elf, as you deem it in your tongue. A child of the solar celestials. And I have taught this class, mostly to young humans, since the Caelian emperors founded this city. I was asked to join the faculty by the first chancellor. I have seen generations of your people come through this classroom, and that alone would well qualify me to answer this question.

What do I think of humans? Well, I will tell you.

I was here, teaching this class during the fire of Enlightenment 373. The fire leveled this city. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine the heat, the death, destruction that such a thing causes?

Six months after the Great Fire, your ancestors had rebuilt … everything. I have seen many miracles in my life. Witnessing that feat might be chief among them.

Liches are almost always humans. Did you know that? I think I know why. Your lives are so short—almost as soon as you’re born, you’re thinking about dying, and you refuse to yield.

That refusal to yield to death … to death … is what drives you, I think. Drives you to leave the world better than you found it. Causes ruined people to rebuild great cities.

We studied human history in this room. Did you feel that those great ancestors of yours were perhaps made of finer stuff than you? Do not think thus. I knew them, and I know you, and your future is greater. I sometimes think each human generation greater than the last—more courageous, more generous. Quicker to forgive.

Today, Ajax’s name is on everyone’s tongue, but I have seen many great evils arise in the world. I was teaching in this classroom when the Pharaoh Khorsekef, desperate, his power failing, opened the Great Tet and drank of the time stored there, becoming the Ultralich. He was defeated, and now rules the Necropolitan Ruin in the Abyssal Waste. I was alive, though not yet a professor, when Cthrion Uroniziir tried to reduce the timescape into one singular universe, wiping out reality as we know it. She was defeated, and we see her cage every day.3

Each of these great evils was defeated by a coalition. The armies and heroes of many speaking peoples. And all of them—all of them—were led … by humans. That’s a fact. That’s history. You can look it up.

Is there some rare trait that makes you uniquely qualified to lead disparate peoples, bring them together to achieve great things? I think … there must be.

Those great humans, your ancestors, did not focus on differences. They did not weigh different people and grade them based on arbitrary traits deemed virtues and flaws. That is what Ajax does. No, those humans focused on the future. On making a better world … for all of us. A world many of them knew they would not live to see. That is a sacrifice … I can scarcely imagine.

The people who stand against Ajax and tyrants like him will be just like you—normal people. Priests and scholars and merchants and farmers. Maybe even teachers. Stopping Ajax will require you to become something else. You must become heroes. Conduits of saints, warmasters of great armies. Censors and shadows. That may seem unlikely now, but the future has a way of surprising us.

Some of your names, I will see written in future textbooks. But some of your names, I will see written in the stars.

### HUMAN TRAITS

Human heroes have access to the following traits.

**Signature Trait: Detect the Supernatural**

As a maneuver, you open your awareness to detect supernatural creatures and phenomena. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any supernatural object, Undead, Construct, or creature from another plane of existence within 5 squares of you, even if you don’t have line of effect to them. You know if you’re detecting an item or a creature, and you know if a creature is Undead, a Construct, or from another plane of existence.

**Purchased Human Traits**

You have 3 ancestry points to spend on the following traits:

- **Can’t Take Hold (Costs 1 Point)**: Your connection to the natural world allows you to resist supernatural effects. You ignore difficult terrain (but not other effects) created by magic and psionic abilities. Additionally, when you are force moved by a magic or psionic ability, you reduce the forced movement by 1.
- **Perseverance (Costs 1 Point)**: Giving up is for other people. You have an edge on tests that use the Endurance skill.
- **Resist the Supernatural (Costs 1 Point)**: Your connection to the natural world protects you from supernatural forces. When you take damage from a Magic or Psionic ability or effect, you can use your triggered action to gain an advantage against the damage.
- **Determination (Costs 2 Points)**: Your anatomical tolerance for pain allows you to push through difficult situations. If you are frightened, slowed, or weakened, you can use a maneuver to immediately end the condition.
- **Staying Power (Costs 2 Points)**: Your human anatomy allows you to fight, run, and stay awake longer than others. Increase your number of Recoveries by 2.

## MEMONEK

"This world of yours. Ships of wood and swords of steel. It’s so … primitive. Like a fairy tale."

"Where do you come from, lady, that our world seems a fable? You have no ships and swords?"

"We have them." Lady Urusistra cast a hand across the sky. "You see those stars? That is my home—the timescape. Our ships are great star freighters that ply the space lanes. And among those stars, light hits as hard as steel."

The native denizens of Axiom, the Plane of Uttermost Law, memonek dwell in a land with lakes and trees and birds and flowers. But on this alien world, the lakes are seas of mercury, the birds glitter with wings of glass stretched gossamer thin, and the flowers’ petals are iridescent metal as flexible and fragile as any earthly rose.

The minds of memonek are highly ordered. Their reason is their great pride. But when descending to the lower planes, including a manifold like Orden where law and chaos mix, a sickness comes over them—an uncontrollable sensation called emotion.

### ON MEMONEK

“You want to tell me what just happened?” Sir John asked.

Count Revile avoided his gaze, then turned and stamped away across the bloody battlefield. 

“I’m fine!” Revile shouted, all evidence to the contrary.

“I know what I saw,” John said as he followed his friend. “You went into a bloodlust. And it’s not the first time. Whether you like it or not, whether I like it or not, I’m in charge of this mission. Either you tell me what’s going on, or I have no choice. I have to conclude you’re a danger to the team and cut you loose.”

Revile stopped and turned to look at the rest of the party, recovering from their wounds. The memonek’s white porcelain chest heaved as he tried to calm himself. His ceramic skin looked as strong as plate, but John knew it was brittle, fragile.

Count Revile took a deep breath. “We call it velloparatha,” he said. “In your tongue it would be … world-sick … or world-sickness? It is a thing that happens … to my people … when they come to your world. It is an illness of … of feeling. Emotion.”

“Are you going mad?” John asked in a whisper.

The memonek smiled ruefully. “It feels that way sometimes. I spent an hour this morning staring at an insect that landed on my finger—a grasshopper, the polder called it. I thought I had never seen a thing so perfect and beautiful. That was awe. As powerful as I have ever felt. In the battle today, anger—just as powerful.

“I thought I could resist it. When I arrived here and felt no different, I thought perhaps world-sickness was a legend. But it is a slow process, this illness, these insidious emotions.”

“No emotions where you’re from?”

Count Revile shook his head. “Not like this. We are creatures of reason, we of Axiom. It is our art, our pride—our religion sometimes, methinks. We have emotions. Joy, sadness, wonder, grief. Love. But they are… a fashion. They do not happen to us. They are something we indulge in, out of propriety. Here… everything is order and chaos mixed—even in me. In me.” Revile placed his hand on his chest.

“In the battle today,” he said. “That anger was not directed at Ajax’s War Dogs. It was directed at myself.”

“At yourself? Why? What did you—”

“John,” the memonek said, and now it was his turn to whisper. “I was afraid. Afraid of … of being wounded, of failing you, failing my friends … of dying. And out of that fear came … enormous anger—at myself. Anger that I was so weak, so … useless. Anger so … strong, so powerful … I forgot who I was.”

John chuckled. “That’s just …” He smiled broadly. “That’s normal, man. That’s just normal. We all feel that way.”

“What? No, you don’t understand—”

“Oh, I don’t understand? Okay, let me guess—it felt like you were gonna piss yourself.”

“Yes!”

“Yeah, happens to all of us.”

“Even you?!”

Sir John shrugged. “Are you kidding? Sure. But it doesn’t help. You still got a job to do. In fact, I’d say that is the job. Anyone can learn the blade.” He placed his hand on the pommel of his sword. “Nothing special about that. It’s learning to deal with the fear. That’s the job—what separates the professionals from the amateurs.”

Count Revile said nothing, just thinking.

“Feeling better?”

Revile nodded. “I always recover afterward, but these outbursts come unbidden, like thunder from a clear sky.”

“Hmm. Yeah. Well, that explains what happened when you met Embers.”

Count Revile did not like being reminded of that. He looked to the sky and shook his head. “I made a fool of myself.”

“Don’t be so hard on yourself. If you’re trying to seduce our void mage, you made a good start of it. She’s three thousand years old, I’ve known her since I was fifteen. I don’t think I’ve ever seen her blush. Anyway, now that I know what’s going on, now that I know you’re basically a giant teenager with overactive glands, I can relax a little.”

Sir John and Count Revile, both tacticians, stood together on the bloody battlefield, looking at each other.

“John, I fear this may get worse before it gets better.”

“So, just like everything else?” He clapped the memonek on the shoulder. “Don’t worry, we’ll get through it together. I’ll let the others know. Once they understand, they’ll help too. They’ll probably just take the piss out of you. That’ll help, you’ll love that.”

“You’re a good friend, John.”

“Heh. Is that you, or the world-sickness talking?”

“Me, I think. The world-sickness would have me say … you’re a bastardly son of a bitch. But you’re my bastardly son of a bitch.” Count Revile smiled.

John laughed and put his arm around his friend as they headed back to the party. “Funny. The world-sickness sounds a lot like me.”

## ORC

“Even should an arrow pierce their heart, each kanin warrior has within them one last act of revenge.”

An anger that cannot be hidden. A fury that drives them in battle. Orcs are famed throughout the world as consummate warriors—a reputation that the peace-loving orcs find distasteful.

The fifth of the speaking peoples, orcs arrived on Orden after humans and elves. They made their homes in the borderlands between those two cultures, preferring the natural forests and avoiding the elf-haunted wodes. For generations, this put them directly in the path of humans who cut down the trees and built roads and farms.

Each orc has within them a fire that causes their veins to glow once blood is drawn. This anger propels them right to the edge of death. The dichotomy between their desire to be left alone and their zeal in battle is summarized in a dwarven proverb:

“Be thankful orcs do not hold grudges.”

### ON ORCS

What a world we have made.  

Indeed, what a marvel!  

It is a marvel now, with the dragons and celestials, elementals and terrans. It is unseemly. It was better before things started talking.  

And having opinions. About our creation. About us!  

Oh, I don’t know. I thought I agreed, but then look you what our sibling Ord has made. A fine people, these elementals. They make marvels. Ord made them, and now they make miracles.  

We make marvels. The world is a miracle, and enough.  

Yes. But still. I think I might try my hand at children. It seems a worthy pursuit.  

Heed the lesson of our Shamèd Brother. It was better before the coming of the terrans. Before the coming of war.  

But war has come. Ord and I are of one mind in this: what is done cannot be undone. My children should not seek war, but they would excel at it should it come to them.  

They would be strong, like the elementals. But theirs would be a strength of spirit. They would never relent, never give up. Always seeking, always striving. Like life itself.  

They should love the forest and green things, like the children of Val. But they should be at home in the cities the terrans and elementals build. In this world of chaos and law, they should seek balance. Not quick to anger. But once angered? A wildfire.  

If they excel at war, the terrans will be jealous. They will be in constant conflict with each other.  

Perhaps. Yes, I think you’re right. It seems to be the great tragedy of our creation, war. But the constant threat of it will bring wisdom. It will take great wisdom to avoid such conflict, and those possessed of such wisdom will become great leaders.  

Would they be lorewise and crafty?  

Oh, I would leave that to them. It is not meet that children should be too closely molded by their parents. But you ask, and my mind goes to Ket. They should lack the pride of Ket’s children…  

Look where that got him.  

Hush, you. We should not be too hard on our Brother In Mourning. He has paid for his hubris. My children would love the world more than lore. That is my answer.  

They seem a fine people, if you ask me.  

And there they are, look at them! Kul, your thoughts made real! Only in the world a little while, and already growing, learning.  

Ah! My children! So fierce and unyielding. I see you lead short lives, like the terrans. Perhaps this is good.  

I see they get along well with Ord’s children. I think this a good sign.  

Already they make homes in the forests by the elves. Some little skirmishing over borders, I note. Nothing serious.  

What shall you call them?  

Oh, I do not care for such things. They should be free of our designs, like the terrans. Let them name themselves.  

Oh! They already have! Kanin. It means “the people” in their tongue. I like that. Very democratic. Good for them.

And will they know you?

If they wish. Much as I agreed with…the Father of Men…I find worship unseemly.  

Agreed.  

Agreed!  

Let me introduce myself, at least.  

Ahem.  

“Hear me, kanin! This world we made is yours, as much as it is anyone’s. You belong here.  

“Know that you are my children, the children of Kul, he who put fire within the world. And there is fire in you. And though the world and fate and baser minds may conspire to destroy your light, you will survive. And more than survive, you will thrive. And in thriving, you will conquer!”

## POLDER

“Wait, where’d he go? Where’d that little son of a bitch go? AAAAGGH!”

After humans, polder are the most numerous and diverse ancestry in Orden. They are not humans, but they live in and amongst humans and share their gods and culture. Almost every human culture in Orden has a polder saint or a human saint venerated by polder.

Short, averaging three and a half feet tall, their origins are obscure. They are a young species who, like humans, have no single patron god. Their ability to shadowmeld means they enjoy a reputation as excellent spies and thieves. Many polder consider this a base slander and point out they’re also famed as chefs, though polder can be found in every profession, especially in cities.

### ON POLDERS

The three peasants—Jago, his wife Sarah, and his sister Beth—sat together watching the three heroes talk in the crowded common room of the inn. Well, Jackson Bootblack seemed to be doing most of the talking.

> “This kind of shit doesn’t work if it’s just a bunch of ratcatchers like us,” the polder said. “You need the people to rise up. Been fifteen years since Omund died—fifteen years of fighting wolves and bandits and worse. The people welcome a tyrant after that. They like order, you know? They adapt.”

> “If you stand on the grass long enough, it learns to lie flat,” *A Mist Coils Around Dying Embers* said. “But what do you say?”

> “Eh?” the polder asked her. But he glanced at Sir John staring at him.

> “You say the people have no stomach for rebellion,” Embers said. “But what about you?”

> “Oh,” the polder said, “I say it doesn’t matter much what I say. Why’s he looking at me like that?” the polder asked the high elf and pointed at Sir John. Realizing he was being rude, John shook his head to clear it. “Sorry, I just … I never met a polder before,” he said.

> “Are you kidding me?” Jackson said.

> “No! Sorry, I just …”

> “What are you, from the moon? Where you from that you never met a polder before? There’s polder in every fucking village and town from here to the sea.”

> “Really? That’s weird. I’m from Tor, I’ve been all over—just never met a polder before.”

Jackson looked at his friend, the high elf void mage. “Am I crazy?”

> “You’re not crazy.” Embers smiled. She was enjoying watching two of her friends get to know each other. “John’s just never run into one, it seems.”

> “Well, we’re adorable,” the polder said, and drank some ale.

> “They must have been around I guess,” John said. “I probably just never noticed.”

The polder put his drink down. “Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. You know, it’s funny. I never have any problem noticing you big assholes. One of you makes about as much noise as a cow, which … I don’t even know how you manage that.”

> “You’re talking just … my voice is just as loud as yours!”

Draw Steel © 2024 MCDM Productions, LLC

> “I mean the way you walk around. Just the way you move, the way you stand up and sit down. You make so much goddamn noise.”

Jago, Sarah, and Beth all smiled at the exchange.

> “Humans are loud, yes,” Embers agreed.

> “Do we have to … can we talk about something else, please?”

> “I just …” The polder wouldn’t let it go. “You seriously never … you never been to an inn? Cavall’s teeth, I can’t count how many inns and taverns I’ve been to run by polders, got polders in the kitchen or waiting tables. One of the only two things we’re good at, I think.”

> “Yeah?” John asked. “What’s the other one?”

The little man smiled.

> “Getting into places we ain’t supposed to be.”

> “Now we’re talking,” Sir John said. “You were saying we need the people behind us. I agree.”

> “Yeah, okay. To business: How to rally the people.” The polder took the question seriously. “It’s not hard. First, we need someone they’ll rally around. I could make someone up, invent a local folk hero, but if we can find the real thing? They just need to look the part, that’s all. I’ll take care of the rest.”

> “I’m working on that,” John said. “But it’s … slower going than I thought. I’m betting on a long shot.”

> “What’s the holdup?”

John thought about how to put what he knew into words.

> “You know,” he shrugged. “Some people can only be heroes if they think they’re better than everyone else. Some people can only be heroes once they realize they’re not. And some people …”

He looked at his drink, at the expensive clear glass the innkeep had given him because he recognized Sir John. He turned the glass slowly on the table and now he was mostly talking to himself.

> “Some people still have to figure that out.”

> “Which is best?” Jackson asked, and Embers could tell the little man was testing John.

John took a deep breath and came back to reality.

> “Well. If we could be picky, we wouldn’t need a hero,” he said.

The polder looked at the high elf and nodded, impressed. Test passed.

> “Okay. Well, if you’ve already got a candidate, I could get things started. The other half is: we need a good story—short, punchy. Something that’ll catch on, needs to be easy to relate to, but bigger than life. A tax. A toll! Bridge toll, classic. An ogre … no, three ogres. Yeah, three is better. Three ogres in Ajax’s livery. A lone figure standing against them. See? Easy.”

> “Where are we going to find three ogres?” John asked.

> “What do you mean?” Now it was the polder’s turn to be confused.

> “What do you mean, ‘What do I mean?’ ” John said. “I’m not … we don’t need real ogres.” Jackson looked at the elf. “Is he for real?”

> “Trust me,” the void mage said.

> “You mean you’re going to make it up?! ” John exclaimed.

> “I…” Jackson looked with incredulity at the high elf void mage, then back at the human. “Yes, I do mean that. Does he know what I do?” he asked the elf.

> “He’ll learn.” Embers smiled.

The polder turned back to Sir John.

> “Hello. I lie for a living. And I’m really good at it. Sometimes also kill people, but only if lying or running away doesn’t work.”

> John turned to Embers. “I thought he was a thief.”

> “I was a thief,” the polder said.

> “You were a thief.”

> “Yeah, I was with the Clock. Probably still am—they don’t exactly let you just walk away. We sort of have an agreement. I agree to do what they tell me and they agree not to tell me to do anything.”

> “Did they kick you out, or did you quit?”

> “Depends on who you ask. I don’t like being told what to do. It’s sort of a polder thing. Hereditary or ancestral or whatever. Everybody wants a polder chef until they start trying to tell us what to cook.”

> “So what are you now?”

> “I’m annoying.”

The elf smiled.

> “He’s a troubadour—one of the best.”

Sir John looked at him, nodded.

> “No lute, I notice. And you don’t seem the type to sit by the hearth telling stories.”

> The polder grinned. “I ain’t that kind of troubadour. I’m the other kind. I think the best story is the one people tell each other.”

> “Propaganda,” Sir John said, a grin spreading across his face. The polder pointed a finger at him and smiled. John heard the door to the inn open behind him. This wasn’t notable, but the gasp from the customers was.

> “Hey,” the polder said, looking past John to the doorway. “Hey, I think our folk hero just showed up. Damn, he looks the part all right. Or she, I can never tell with these guys.”

John turned to see.

Sir Vaantikalisax loomed just inside the doorway, his scales and armor glowing in the light of the hearth fire. Sir John shot up out of his chair, a huge smile on his face.

> “I, uh …” Vaantikalisax said. The tall, broad draconian looked from John to the three peasants. Jago, Sarah, and Beth were beaming with even more joy than John, if that were possible.

The knight stared at them for a moment, then turned back to his friend.

> “Maybe you’re right,” the dragon knight said.

## REVENANT

> “I will suck the life from your flesh and leave you a withered corpse!”

The revenant null flexed his arms and assumed a fighting pose. He smiled.

> “Little late for that.”

The dead walk among us. Some of them are happier about it than others.

Unlike the necromantic rituals that produce wights and wraiths and zombies, revenants rise from the grave through a combination of an unjust death and a burning desire for vengeance. Creatures sustained on pure will, they have no need of food or water or air—and, unlike their zombified cousins, they retain all their memories and personality from life.

These revenants are rare. Many are hunted by ignorant villagers who see only their dead flesh and assume the worst. Those who survive the pitchfork brigade either choose a solitary life, often as a wandering soul seeking out living company yet constantly in fear of it, or they migrate to a metropolis such as Blackbottom or Capital, where lost souls gather to make a home.

### ON REVENANTS

> “I’m telling you, we are being followed.”

> “No one knows we’re here. No one even knows this place exists! We got all day. We stash everything here, and take a sample to …” The head thief pulled a vial out of a crate stuffed with straw and looked at it.

> “It’s just …” The junior cutpurse spoke nervously. “There was this lady knight in Blackbottom sniffing around. She seemed serious. I got this weird … chill when I looked at her.”

> “Hey,” the head thief said, his brow furrowed as he looked at the label on the vial. “Where’d you say you bought this stuff? You said a ship—a ship from where?”

> “I dunno, uh … uh, Capital I think.”

The head thief looked at the panicking cutpurse.

> “This lady knight—she have a red and blue device on her shield?”

> “Black gods,” one of the other thieves said. “It can’t be Lady Filliamo, can it?”

There was a firm knock at the door to the safe house. A door which, from the outside, looked like an unremarkable section of wall.

> “Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me.”

> “Nonono! How could she … Capital was nine months ago!”

> “She’s a revenant, idiot! She doesn’t even need air. She could have walked here! Just … into the water and across the bottom of the sea! Black gods, why didn’t you say anything?”

> “I did! You asshole, I just did! I been trying to tell you for—”

> “Man, there is a difference between, ‘Hey I think we’re being shadowed,’ and, ‘There’s a deathless copper coming after us!’ ”

One of the four thieves opened a vial and dipped his dirk into the red oil within.

> “What is that gonna do? She’s already dead!” Another knock at the hidden door. “Forget it. Let her knock. Grab as many as you can, and we’ll go out the back.”

The head thief ran for the door out the back of the safe house. He jerked it open—and the other thieves watched as a silver flash silently flared across his forehead. Through the open door, they could see the silhouette of the knight, her open hand held up in front of her.

She clenched her hand into a fist and the judgment she had placed on the head cutpurse detonated, hurling him backwards. He sprawled across the floor, conscious but stunned.

The gray-skinned knight walked into the room. Metal heels rang out on the wooden floor. She seemed relaxed, but her eyes burned with inner fire.

> “Boys,” Lady Filliamo said pleasantly. “Busy morning.”

> “How did you … this is impossible, how did you find us?”

She looked at the man groaning on the floor.

> “Your boss didn’t tell you about the vengeance mark?”

> “You marked us. Back in Capital. You marked one of us and just … just walked here.”

> “Don’t be stupid. I marked you in Blackbottom. Capital was just normal detective work. I came here by ship.” She smiled—black lips on pale gray skin.

> “Come on.” The braver of the three remaining thieves drew twin daggers. “She can’t get all of us at—”

Lady Filliamo made a broad gesture with her right hand and argent marks flared across the foreheads of all three thieves. A clatter of weapons hitting the floor. Three pairs of hands slowly rose in the air.

> “Good boys. Here, put these on.” She tossed three pairs of manacles on the floor.

> “Hang on, you can’t arrest us,” one of the thieves, unarmed and still holding his hands up, said. “This isn’t Capital. You don’t have jurisdiction!”

Lady Filliamo shrugged.

> “I’m a knight of the church. Jurisdiction’s for the city watch.” She drew her silver sword a few inches from the scabbard just to show them the blade.

> “I deal in steel.”

### REVENANT TRAITS

**Revenant heroes have the following traits.**

#### SIGNATURE TRAIT: FORMER LIFE

Choose the ancestry you were before you died. Your size equals that ancestry’s size. Your speed is 5. You lose all other ancestral benefits from your original ancestry.

Your undead body grants you cold, corruption, lightning immunity, and poison immunity equal to your level. You also have fire weakness 5. You can’t suffocate, and you don’t need to eat or drink to stay alive.

Additionally, when your Stamina equals the negative of your winded value, you become inert instead of dying. You can continue to observe your surroundings, but you can’t speak, take actions, maneuvers, or triggered actions, or move and you fall prone. If you take any fire damage while in this state, your body is destroyed and you die. Otherwise, after 12 hours, you regain Stamina equal to your recovery value.

You always know the direction to the exact location of a creature who bears one of your sigils and is on the same world as you.

You can have an active number of sigils equal to your level. You can remove a sigil from a creature harmlessly (no action required). If you are already using your maximum number of sigils and place a new one, your oldest sigil disappears with no other effect.

**Effect:** The sigil disappears from the creature.

## TIME RAIDER

> “I fear no living thing, but the time raiders.”  
—Chief Executive Admiral Lithiri Aswandala, Commander of the HOV First Get Behind Them Memonek

The original servitor species of the synliiroi—evil psions with near god-like power—the kuran’zoi liberated themselves during the First Psychic War. In the centuries since, they built their own culture and civilization as nomads of the timescape. The exonym “time raiders” was given to them by denizens of the lower worlds who, seeing the advanced technology they wield, concluded they must be from the future.

Extraordinarily rare in Orden, the time raiders thrive on the Sea of Stars, the Sea Between Worlds, where the winds of limbo roar.

In place of eyes, kuran'zoi possess crystalline ocular sensors that grant them high-spectral vision hardened against the extreme radiations encountered in the Sea of Stars, permitting them to operate freely outside their vessels with only their portable rebreathers. Time raiders also have two sets of arms, allowing them to wield melee weapons at the same time as ranged weapons. A single well-trained kuran’zoi is like a squad unto themself.

# ON TIME RAIDERS

> “You will tell me the location of the ship you came here in.”

Taxiarch Lycaon paced outside the ruined church. The four-armed woman with crystal eyes and flaming pink hair in a strip down the center of her shaved head sneered at him. She was chained to the ruin of a stone column outside the ruin of a stone church.

> “Is it that your brain is so small you must talk in order to think?” The woman’s smile was a sneer.

Lycaon strode toward the alien, grabbed a length of chain around her waist, and yanked on it, pulling it taut so the chain around her neck tightened.

> “You are going to die in any event,” he said. “If you wish to deny me the pleasure of hearing you howl and scream for mercy, tell me what I want to know now and my dogs will kill you quickly.”

Up close, she could see the fine stitching along Lycaon’s cheeks and forehead, the very slight differences in skin tone that showed his skin was not his own.

> “You seem to be made of bits,” the alien said as she peered at Lycaon, her crystalline eyes catching and reflecting prismatic light. “And not the best bits. Leftovers? Is that what you are? A walking assemblage of cast-off scraps? Hahah, I thought the proteans were hideous. Someone should let them know! There are creatures even more foul-seeming and useless in the timescape.”

The Taxiarch smiled to himself, nodded with respect at the woman’s epithets. He placed his foot on a low piece of rubble, once part of the wall of the stone church, and leaned his arm on his knee. He was not dressed as the other war dogs. No black leather for him. He wore a gold breastplate with the embossed head of a ram molded into it, a white cape over his back. Gold greaves and red leather boots and gloves. The other war dogs only had patches of hair, but his was long and blonde.

He struck a casual, jaunty pose.

> “Where is your worldship?” he said in a more reasonable voice. “Or came you here in a single-seater starskimmer?”

At this, the alien’s crystal eyes went wide, betraying surprise.

> “You see?” The Taxiarch said, impressed with himself. “I am not a primitive like these peasants, who hounded you because you are alien,” he nodded at the folk of the small town watching from the stables some distance away. “I am Ajax’s elite. Better than his chosen. I was made for victory.”

Indeed, Taxiarch Lycaon looked almost fully human. Handsome and fit like a statue from Phaedros, which his model had almost certainly been inspired by. Unless you looked closely, there was no sign he was a product of the body banks.

> “If you agree to lead me to your vessel, I will let you go free.”

The alien sighed.

> “‘Blaap blaap blaap,’” she said. “You should hear yourself. Like barking thrazz, you sound to me. Who holds your leash I wonder? For surely a microbrain such as you could not command any more than these rabble,” she nodded her head at the other twenty or so war dogs.

Her taunts worked. Lycaon hauled back and punched the alien in the jaw. Her head smashed into the ruined column. She was dazed but she shook it off and laughed.

> “Look how easily this one is goaded!” she said. She spat out dark blue blood and turned to the peasants gathered. “You people! Why do you let yourselves be cowed by these … bits? Bits of people kludged together? Even the least of you is worth more than these.”

> “Perhaps from the air,” Flight Captain Lyria offered, and she stroked the feathers of her giant hawk mount to calm it. “I could scout the forest around the …”

> “No!” Taxiarch Lycaon pointed a finger at the hawklord and strode toward her. “You are the elite of Ajax’s winged harriers, I am his chosen brigade commander. We are not scavengers! This one,” he stabbed a gloved finger at the alien, “will come to heel, or I will give her to my war dogs.”

He turned to face the chained alien, who yawned. Lycaon seethed.

> “They may pull you apart,” he said to her, and at this, his squadron of soldiers, all in black leather and golden pauldrons, started making barking sounds. Then they laughed at each other.

> “Or I may let my crucibite melt the skin from your bones.”

At that, a war dog clad in leather from head to foot, wearing a heavy mask with glass circles where the eyes should be, and some kind of canister over his mouth stepped forward. The long, thin brass tube in his hands connected to a large metal tank on his back.

> “Shall I let you choose?” the Taxiarch said and drew a dagger from his belt. “I will cut off one finger. If you cry out, I kill you. If not, another finger. And if you cry out then…”

Slowly everyone assembled could make out the sounds of a conversation, quiet with a metallic ring to it. The voices got louder until eventually, they could be heard.

> “... should be ready for anything,” one voice said, deep, commanding, and images started to form around and between the war dogs, the hawklord, and the Taxiarch. Like faded images in a manuscript they seemed, gaining pigment and clarity and, eventually, depth as their voices grew louder and clearer.

> “Oh, thank you for the brilliant tactical advice,” another voice, high-pitched, piped up.

Suddenly, the images became three-dimensional, solid, and four heroes stood among them. A human in working battle plate. A polder with twin rapiers in his hands. A tall willowy high elf with night-black skin and golden hair. And a Dragon Knight. The people of the town gasped when they saw him. Even at a distance, even with the war dogs between them, they recognized the device of Good King Omund on the knight’s shield.

The war dogs scrambled. For a moment, it seemed they might flee at this sudden intrusion, but the Taxiarch Lycaon bellowed “Hold fast!” and they held their ground, uncertainty over the unknown threat of a band of heroes battling in each of them with the certain fear of their commander.

John immediately read the situation. It was a clear enough picture.

There was something about the war dogs. They loved Ajax’s cruelty—reveled in it. John had crossed swords with other commanders in Ajax’s army before. Ground Commander Vordokov was a professional—could be reasoned with, but he was an orc.

Not the war dogs—they were fanatics.

> “What’s this?” the Taxiarch called out with a hungry grin. “Allies of the alien?” He was projecting confidence, trying to muster his wary soldiers.

Sir John ignored the war dog, tilted his head toward the alien.

> “Embers?”

> “A kuran’zoi,” the high elf said, and the alien held her head up with pride. “A time raider from the upper worlds. What the truth is I cannot say, and no people are all one thing. But by reputation? They’re intractable, ungovernable, they loathe authority, hate tyranny and are totally, utterly without fear.”

John watched the alien. They sneered their approval at Ember’s summary. That was enough for Sir John; they could work out the details later. After everything they’d been through before, he trusted Embers implicitly.

He could see the shape of the next moments play out; all he had to do was take the initiative. If he was right, the whole thing would be over in seconds. There was no time to communicate. No time to plan, and everyone, everyone had to play their part.

John knew what came next, but he wasn’t an assassin. He had his own part to play. He took a step forward, away from his teammates, and noted the Taxiarch didn’t react. This spoke volumes. He locked eyes with his enemy.

> “She goes free,” John commanded, his voice steel, “or you die here.” 

He could feel the muscles tightening in his comrades, the whole company like a steel spring wound tight.

Lycaon cocked his head at Sir John and took a few foolish steps toward the tactician. He was just out of reach. But close enough.

> “I see you are a man, like Ajax. Why do you lower yourself with these … creatures?” the war dog Taxiarch looked at the elf, polder, and dragon knight. “Little more than slimy things crawled out of the sea? Join us. Join me. Join Ajax. It’ll be nice for you,” his voice lowered almost to a whisper, “to be on the winning side for a change.”

Sir John took a deep breath, his body language changed and that was enough. Several things then happened at once, so quickly no one would later be able to say who acted first.

Ember’s eyes flashed into a starfield. The time raider’s chains dissolved into starspace and reappeared around Flight Captain Lyria pinning her arms to her side. She was giving the hawklord an excuse to sit this one out. Gods, John was glad she was with them.

The time raider’s right upper hand shot out, as though she’d been waiting for the void mage to do exactly what she just did, and her meson blaster leapt out of the hands of the war dog who’d chained her. The pistol made of glass and bronze slammed into her hand and its tip flared with prismatic light.

From the sun’s shadow cast by Taxiarch Lycaon, the polder Jackson Bootblack emerged, a rapier in each hand, and no one had seen him move from where he’d been a moment before.

At the same instant, a call—a horn. From directly behind John a blast of sound like a chord played by a dozen trumpets, and hope sang in John’s heart—the Clarion Call of the last Storm Knight!

John hadn’t hesitated; he’d already drawn his sword.

> “Alright, you patchwork son of a bitch.” He charged Lycaon who fumbled with the short-sword on his belt.

> “Draw steel!”

# CULTURE

What makes a hero? Is their desire to stand up for the innocent and protect others somehow innate? Are they born knowing that tyrants must fall? Does a higher power instill the idea that sometimes those least deserving of compassion are those who need it most? 

No. A hero’s life experience teaches them right from wrong—and that experience starts with the culture that raised them.

*Playtest note: Sample cultures are coming.*

## CREATING A CULTURE

A hero’s culture describes the beliefs, customs, values, and way of life held by the community in which they were raised. This community provides life experiences that give a character some of their game statistics. Even if a hero doesn’t share their culture’s values, those values shaped their early development and way of life. In fact, some people become heroes primarily from the rejection of the ways of their culture.

For our purposes, a hero’s culture represents people, not a place. Yes, you might have grown up in the city of Capital, but your culture is more specific than that. One hero’s culture might be House Alvaro, a noble house in Capital where they were raised. Another’s culture could be a group or organization that moves around, such as a band of pirates or a secret order of sorcerers sworn to protect books of fell magic. It helps to get specific when thinking about your culture, and working with the four aspects of a culture can help you do that: language, environment, organization, and upbringing.

### USING CULTURE

Directors can use the rules in this section to build cultures that players can choose for their characters. Players can use these rules to build a unique culture or modify an existing culture for their character, working with the Director to find a right place for that culture within the world of the campaign’s world. The Vasloria Cultures table provides a cultural breakdown for Vasloria, the game’s medieval European fantasy analog. *Playtest note: That table is still to come.* You can use the table for a campaign that takes place in Vasloria, or pillage from it liberally for a custom setting.

In many worlds, at least some cultures have a majority ancestry. The people of Bedegar, a duchy in Vasloria, are mostly humans. The folk dwelling in the Great Wode, a forest realm north of Bedegar, are primarily wode elves. However, you can always choose to be from one of these cultures and take a different ancestry. A dwarf raised in the culture of the Great Wode speaks Yllyric and probably knows a lot about nature, while a dwarf raised in the dwarven thanedom of Kal Kalavar speaks Zaliac and might know a good deal about smithing.

### WHY BUILD A CULTURE?

Building a character is about more than adding up your stats, picking skills and abilities, and recording that information on a character sheet. You’re building a hero—a main character in a story, be it a one-shot or a heroic campaign. Think about the personality and the past of who you are creating. That’s why the game lets you build a culture rather than simply saying, “Pick three skills and a bonus language.” We want players to imagine their heroes as complex and intricate characters.

## CULTURE BENEFITS

The culture you choose or create grants you the following benefits:

- **You know the language of your culture, in addition to knowing Caelian.**
- **From the environment, organization, and upbringing aspects of your culture, you gain access to skills.** You can select one skill from each aspect’s list of options. *(See Skills for details.)*
- **You gain an edge on tests to recall lore about your culture, and on tests to influence and interact with people of your culture.**

### LANGUAGE

Your culture’s language aspect determines how the people of your culture communicate. This can be any language in *Languages*.

### ENVIRONMENT

Your culture’s environment aspect describes where the people of that culture spend most of their time. Is your culture centered in a bustling city or a small village? Did you spend your early life in an isolated monastery? Or did you wander the wilderness, never staying in one place for long?

When you build a culture, select its environment aspect from the following options: nomadic, rural, secluded, urban, or wilderness. You then gain skill options from your chosen environment. All of these environments can be found in any sort of terrain, whether aboveground, in subterranean caverns, deep in trackless forest, or even underwater.

#### NOMADIC

A nomadic culture travels from place to place to survive. They might follow animal migrations or the weather, travel to sell their wares or services, or simply enjoy a restless lifestyle full of new experiences and peoples. Those who grow up in nomadic cultures learn to navigate the wilderness and interact with others.

**Skill Options:** One skill from the exploration or interpersonal skill groups.

#### RURAL

A rural culture is one located in a town, village, or smaller settled enclave. People dwelling in such places often cultivate the land, trade goods or services with travelers passing through, harvest fish from the sea, or mine metals and gems from the earth.

Living among a small population, most folks in a rural community learn a trade and are handed down bits of essential knowledge to help their community survive.

For example, when a rural culture has only one blacksmith, it’s important to have an apprentice already learning at the anvil well before that smith starts to get old. If the only priest in town gets the sniffles, folks want an acolyte ready to wear the fancy robes should the worst occur.  
**Skill Options:** One skill from the crafting or lore skill groups.

#### SECLUDED

A secluded culture is based in one relatively close-quarters structure—a building, a cavern, and so forth—and interacts with other cultures only rarely. Such places are often buildings or complexes such as monasteries, castles, or prisons. Folk in a secluded culture have little or no reason to leave their home or interact with other cultures on the outside, but might have an awareness of those cultures and of events happening outside their enclave.

When people live together in close quarters, they typically learn to get along. They often spend much time in study or introspection, as there is not much else to do in seclusion.  
**Skill Options:** One skill from the interpersonal or lore skill groups.

#### URBAN

An urban culture is always centered in a city. Such a culture might arise within the walls of Capital, a massive metropolis with a cosmopolitan population; within a network of caverns that hold an underground city; or in any other place where a large population lives relatively close together. The people of urban cultures often learn to effectively misdirect others in order to navigate the crowds and the political machinations that can come with city life.  
**Skill Options:** One skill from the interpersonal or intrigue skill groups.

#### WILDERNESS

A wilderness culture doesn’t attempt to tame the terrain in which its people live, whether desert, forest, swamp, tundra, ocean, or more exotic climes. Instead, the folk of such a culture thrive amid nature, taking their sustenance and shelter from the land itself. A wilderness culture might be a circle of druids protecting a great wode, a band of brigands hiding out in desert caves, or a camp of orc mercenaries who call the trackless mountains home. People in a wilderness culture learn how to use the land for all they need to live, typically crafting their own tools, clothing, and more.  
**Skill Options:** One skill from the crafting or exploration skill groups.

### ORGANIZATION

Your culture’s organization aspect determines the functioning and leadership of your community. You might come from a place with an officially recognized government and a system of laws. Or your culture might have enjoyed a less formal organization, with the people in charge having naturally gravitated toward their positions without any official offices or oaths.

When you build a culture, select its organization aspect from the following options: anarchic, bureaucratic, or communal. You then gain skill options from your chosen system of organization.

#### ANARCHIC

In an anarchic culture, there are no rules and no one person leads the others. This might sound like complete chaos—people taking what they want when they want it—and some cultures that practice anarchy are. Other anarchic cultures are peaceful places where people mostly work for themselves, their friends, or their family, but rely on the whole group when times get tough.

Many anarchic cultures come together when the need arises, but they leave day-to-day responsibilities up to the individual. If an informal leader appears, it’s because each member of the culture has decided to follow that person for a time, and the leader enjoys their power only as long as they keep everyone happy. A group of rangers who protect a vast forest, a gang of rebels fighting against a tyrannical despot leader, and a bandit group roving the wilds without a leader are all anarchic cultures.

Most anarchic cultures operate outside of settled lands, sticking to the wilds, city sewers, or other secret places. For even when such cultures are harmless, their members know that outsiders might try to impose rules upon them if they live in the same place. As such, many folks in anarchic cultures learn how to navigate the wilds and fend for themselves while avoiding the danger that other folks can represent.  
**Skill Options:** One skill from the exploration or intrigue skill groups.

#### BUREAUCRATIC

Bureaucratic cultures are steeped in official leadership and formally recorded laws. Members of such a culture are often ranked in power according to those laws, with a small group of people holding the power to rule according to birthright, popular vote, or some other official and measurable standard. Many bureaucratic communities have one person at the very top, though others might be ruled by a council. A trade guild with a guildmaster, treasurer, secretary, and a charter of rules and regulations for membership; a feudal lord who rules over a group of knights, who in turn rule over peasants who work the land; and a militaristic society with ranks and rules that its people must abide are all examples of bureaucratic cultures.

Those who thrive in bureaucratic cultures don’t just follow the rules. They know how to use those rules to their advantage, either bending, changing, or reinterpreting policy to advance their own interests. Schmoozing with those who make the laws is often key to this approach. Others in a bureaucratic culture might specialize in operating outside the strict regulations that govern the culture without getting caught.  
**Skill Options:** One skill from the intrigue or lore skill groups.

#### COMMUNAL

A communal culture is a place where all members of the collective are considered equal. The community works together to make important decisions that affect the majority of the culture.

each person has a relatively equal say in how the culture operates, and everyone contributes to help their people survive and thrive. Individuals often share the burdens of governing, physical labor, childcare, and other duties. A collective of farmers who work together to cultivate and protect their land without a noble, a city of pirates where each person can do as they wish, and a traveling theatrical troupe whose members vote on every artistic and administrative decision are all communal cultures.

People in communal cultures learn that their voice and individuality have worth, as do the opinions and hard work of others.  
**Skill Options:** One skill from the crafting or interpersonal skill groups.

### UPBRINGING

Your culture’s upbringing aspect is a more specific and personal part of your hero’s story, describing how you were individually raised within your culture. Were you trained to become the newest archmage in a secret order of wizards, or to be a sword-wielding bodyguard who protected that arcane organization? Did you learn to delve deep into mines looking for ore in a mountain kingdom, or did you build machines meant to dig faster and deeper than any person could alone? Whatever your culture, your upbringing makes you special within that culture.

Pick your upbringing aspect from the following list: academic, creative, illegal, labor, martial, or noble. You then gain skill options from your chosen aspect.

#### ACADEMIC

Heroes with an academic upbringing were raised by people who collect, study, and share books and other records. Some academics focus on one area of study, such as a college for wizards dedicated to the study of magic, or a church that teaches the word of one deity. People in an academic culture learn how to wield the power that is knowledge.  
**Skill Options:** One skill from the lore skill group.

#### CREATIVE

Heroes with a creative upbringing were raised among folk who create art or other works valuable enough to trade. A creative culture might produce fine art such as dance, music, or sculpture, or more practical wares such as wagons, weapons, tools, or buildings. People in such cultures learn the value of quality crafting and attention to detail.  
**Skill Options:** The Music or Perform skill, or one skill from the crafting skill group.

#### ILLEGAL

Heroes with an illegal upbringing had caregivers who performed activities that other folk—whether within or outside their culture—considered unlawful. A band of pirates, a guild of assassins, or an organization of spies all commit unlawful acts for money. People with illegal upbringings typically don’t mind breaking the rules when it suits them—and are good at making sure no one finds out they did.  
**Skill Options:** One skill from the intrigue skill group.

#### LABOR

People who labor for a living survive through cultivation, typically raising crops or livestock on a farm; by harvesting natural resources, whether by hunting, trapping, logging, or mining; or through manual labor tied to settlement and trade, such as construction, carting, loading cargo, and so forth. People with a labor upbringing know the value of hard work.  
**Skill Options:** One of the Blacksmithing or Handle Animals skills, or one skill from the exploration skill group.

#### MARTIAL

Heroes who have a martial upbringing are raised by warriors. These might be the soldiers of an established army, a band of mercenaries, a guild of monster-slaying adventurers, or any other folk whose lives revolve around combat. Heroes with a martial upbringing are always ready for a fight—and they know how to finish that fight.  
**Skill Options:** One of the Alertness, Blacksmithing, Climb, Endurance, Fletching, Intimidate, Jump, Monsters, Ride, or Track skills.

#### NOBLE

Heroes with a noble upbringing were raised by leaders who rule over others and play the games of politics to maintain power. Many families are nobles by birthright, but some cultures have noble titles that are earned through deeds or popularity. Whatever the case, heroes with this background understand why the whispered words in the right ear can sometimes be more powerful than any army.  
**Skill Options:** One skill from the interpersonal skill group.

### BUT I REALLY WANT ALERTNESS

If the culture you create doesn’t grant a skill that you want, check with your Director about modifying what the culture’s aspects offer. For instance, you can easily make the case that a culture with the martial upbringing aspect should give a character access to the Alertness skill, given that being successful in battle means always being aware of your surroundings.

# CAREER

Hero isn’t a job. It’s a calling. But before you answered that call, you had a different job or vocation that paid the bills. Thank the gods for that, because the experience you gained in that career is now helping you save lives and slay monsters.

## CAREER QUESTIONS

The careers in this section don’t go into great detail about the actual jobs they represent. We assume that you know the basics of what an artisan, a criminal, or a gladiator does for a living. However, each career does include a list of questions that you should think about to help you define the specific details of your hero’s career. For instance, if you pick the Artisan career, one of the questions is, “What did you create?” You don’t need to answer these questions, but doing so helps shape a more complete picture of your hero.

## CAREER BENEFITS

Your career describes what your life was before you became a hero. When you select a career, you gain a number of benefits, the details of which are specified in the career’s description.

### SKILLS

Each career grants you two or three skills. If a career grants you a skill you already have, you can select a different skill.

### LANGUAGES

Some careers allow you to learn extra languages, chosen from those available in Languages.

### RENOWN

Some careers increase your starting Renown score. See Renown in Other Rewards for more information.

If your career or another option doesn’t increase your Renown score, then your starting score is 0.

### WEALTH

Some careers increase your starting Wealth score. See Wealth in Other Rewards for more information.

If your career or another option doesn’t increase your Wealth score, then your starting score is 1.

### PROJECT POINTS

Some careers provide project points that you can put toward research and crafting projects (see Research and Crafting in future packets for more information). These points can be divided among multiple projects, but they can’t be used more than once. At the Director’s discretion, your career might also let you start the game with the materials needed for one or more projects, so that you can immediately put your project points toward them, possibly before the adventure begins!

### PERK

Your career provides you with a perk. You can select a perk of the type provided by the career. See Perks for more information.

## INCITING INCIDENT

Each career has a list of inciting incidents, each of which suggests a potential reason why you gave up your career, turned away from a possibly comfortable and reliable living, and took up the sword (or axe or wand) to become an adventuring hero. Each inciting incident represents a life-changing event that might have motivated you to change course, becoming a person who risks it all to save others.

You can roll for or choose an inciting incident from the table that accompanies each career. You can also use the table as inspiration and work with your Director to come up with a unique inciting incident of your own.

_(Playtest note: There are currently only three inciting incidents for many careers. More are coming.)_

### WHAT WAS TAKEN FROM YOU?

During your inciting incident, something was taken from you. It might have been a material object, such as an heirloom sword or a locket that proves your royal heritage. It could be a person you loved who was killed, kidnapped, or cursed. It might be something deeper and more abstract, as with a chance for happiness or a lifetime goal snatched away.

It might be the case that you’re obsessed with getting back what you lost. You might be in a position where you’ll never recover what was taken from you, but you want to prevent that same loss from happening to others. It might be a little bit of both. Whatever the case, the loss you’ve suffered is part of what drives you to be a hero. Record what was taken from you on your character sheet, and let your Director know.

## AGENT

You worked as a spy for a government or organization. In defining your career, think about the following questions:

- Who did you work for?
- Who did you spy on?
- Who shouldn’t know your true identity and allegiance but does?
- Who did you have to burn or leave behind to get a job done?

You gain the following career benefits:

- **Skills:** The Stealth skill, plus one skill from the interpersonal skill group and one skill from the intrigue skill group.
- **Languages:** Two languages.
- **Perk:** One perk from the intrigue perk type.

### AGENT INCITING INCIDENTS

| d6 | Incident |
|----|----------|
| 1  | **Disavowed:** While on a dangerous espionage assignment, things went sideways. Although you escaped with your life, the mission was a public failure thanks to bad information your agency gave you. They denied you work for them, and you went on the run. Hero work will let you survive and clear your name. |
| 2  | **Faceless:** Your identity was always hidden. It was your way of protecting those around you because the work you did spying on powerful entities came with dangers. Then your world came crashing down when an enemy agent unmasked you, causing you to lose everything—privacy, livelihood, loved ones, all gone in the blink of an eye. Instead of going into hiding, you became a public hero to protect the innocent in the name of those you lost. |
| 3  | **Free Agent:** There was a time in your life when you used to sell information to the highest bidder. Your acts were unsanctioned by any one organization, but you were well-connected enough to trade in secrets. Politics never mattered much to you until the information you sold wound up causing a ripple effect of harm that eventually destroyed the place you once called home. You became a hero to make up for your past. |
| 4  | **Informed:** After years of cultivating a rich list of informants, one risked everything to expose heinous plans by powerful individuals. You promised to protect your informant, but your agency left them hanging—literally. You cut ties with your employer and swore to always make good on your word as a hero. |
| 5  | **Spy Who Loved Me:** While embedded in an undercover assignment, you fell for someone on the other side. Your lies were discovered, and though you insisted your feelings were real, the deceit cut too deep for your love interest to look past. That person exposed you, spurned you, or died because of their closeness to you. You left the espionage business to become a hero with nothing to hide. |
| 6  | **Turncoat:** You spent your life in service of your country or an organization that upheld your values. During your undercover operations, you discovered everything you were told was a lie. Whether you confronted your superiors or were exposed, your service medals were stripped of you before you left to become a true hero. |

## ARISTOCRAT

Career? Who needs a career when you’re born with a lot of money! Or marry into it! Or con your way into it! Whatever the case, you didn’t need to work thanks to (someone’s) generational wealth. In defining your career, think about the following questions:

- How did you become an aristocrat?
- What did you do to fill your days?
- Which aristocrats and people who worked for you were your best friends and greatest enemies?
- What sentimental heirloom from your old estate do you carry, and what does it mean to you?

You gain the following career benefits:

- **Skills:** One skill from the interpersonal skill group and one skill from the lore skill group.
- **Languages:** One language.
- **Renown:** +1.
- **Wealth:** +1.
- **Perk:** One perk from the lore perk type.

### ARISTOCRAT INCITING INCIDENTS

| d6 | Incident |
|----|----------|
| 1  | **Blood Money:** When you entered adulthood, you heard unsavory whispers about your family’s fortune before learning that their wealth came at the cost of others’ suffering. Whether you shed light on the secret or not, you left to become a hero stripped of noble title. |
| 2  | **Charmed Life:** Through some treasure or innate ability, you were able to defraud other aristocrats. You did it for fun. When you were found out, you lost your status. Whether you served time or escaped from punishment, you decided to rehabilitate yourself and became a hero to earn an honest living. |
| 3  | **Inheritance:** The very guardians who instilled in you the virtues of doing the right thing were murdered in a senseless petty robbery. Though their wealth was bequeathed to you, it did little to assuage the guilt you felt for not being able to stop the deadly crime. You decided to use your riches to fund your life as a hero, whether publicly or using an alter-ego. |
| 4  | **Privileged Position:** Life outside the manor never piqued your interest. You had everything you wanted. It came as a surprise when the peasants came to overthrow your family. You narrowly escaped, and for the first time witnessed the world. It caused you to become a hero for the people, fighting against inequities. |
| 5  | **Royal Pauper:** Seeking a break from noble duties, you sought a lookalike to switch identities. It went so well that you made a habit of switching whenever bored. Unfortunately, your counterpart became so good at imitating you that they convinced everyone you were an imposter. You lost contact with your family, but pursue a heroic path free of the pomp of your old life. |
| 6  | **Wicked Secret:** One parent passed away when you were a baby and the other remarried years later. They died under suspicious circumstances. Their spouse ousted you, and you were banished (and possibly hunted). Rising from tragedy, you have sought to right the wrongs of the world. |

## ARTISAN

You made and sold useful wares. In defining your career, think about the following questions:

- What did you create?
- Who taught you your craft?
- Was there any particular creation you were known for?

You gain the following career benefits:

- **Skills:** Two skills from the crafting skill group.
- **Languages:** One language.
- **Project Points:** 240.
- **Perk:** One perk from the crafting perk type.

### ARTISAN INCITING INCIDENTS

| d3 | Incident |
|----|----------|
| 1  | **Continue the Work:** A great hero was a fan of the things you created and gave you a generous commission to create your best work for them. While working on this commission, you and the hero became close friends. The day you finished the work was the same day they disappeared. To honor their legacy, you took up the mantle of a hero with the intent of finishing your friend’s work. |
| 2  | **Inspired:** As you traveled the road selling your wares, troll bandits attacked you. One of the bandits claimed an item belonging to someone precious to you—or perhaps claimed that person’s life—but the rest were driven off or slain by a group of heroes. Seeing the quick work these heroes made of the bandits inspired you to follow in their footsteps. |
| 3  | **Robbery:** A criminal gang stole your goods and harmed a number of people who worked for you. You became a hero to prevent such indignities from being visited upon others, to seek revenge for the assault, or to find the thieves and get your stuff back. |

## BEGGAR

You lived by going to a tavern, crossroads, city street, or other busy area and begging the passersby for money or food. In defining your career, think about the following questions:

- What are the unfortunate circumstances that led you to becoming a beggar?
- Where did you beg?
- Who made sport out of bullying you?
- Who showed you the most kindness?

You gain the following career benefits:

- **Skills:** The Rumors skill, plus one skill from the exploration skill group and one skill from the interpersonal skill group.
- **Languages:** Two languages.
- **Perk:** One perk from the interpersonal perk type.

### BEGGAR INCITING INCIDENTS

| d6 | Incident |
|----|----------|
| 1  | **Champion:** You were never content with your lot. Watching yet another friend fall to preventable circumstances was your last straw. You gathered up what little you had and set off to become a hero, determined to make real change for those society forgot. |
| 2  | **Night Terrors:** Something killed the other beggars. It came in the night. You barely saw it, but what you saw of it wasn’t natural. You survived by hiding, or maybe it simply passed you over for reasons unknown to you. It still haunts your nightmares, and you kill monsters so no one else has to experience such horrors. |
| 3  | **One Good Deed:** You ran afoul of the local watch by being in the wrong place when they were in a bad mood. A passing hero intervened on your behalf, shaming the guards into moving on, then gave you enough gold to get you back on your feet. Their kindness kindled a spark in you. You took the gold, bought some secondhand gear, and went to pay that hero’s kindness forward. |
| 4  | **Precious:** No matter how far you’d fallen, there was one belonging you would never part with, no matter how much money it would bring you. When a pickpocket nicked it, you chased them until you were in a part of the city you no longer recognized. With a jolt, you realized you had no desire to return to your previous stomping grounds. You kept going, and you haven’t looked back. |
| 5  | **Strange Charity:** A passerby dropped something in your cup. When you counted your day’s collections, you found a magic coin among the coppers. You knew immediately that it was special. When the other beggars—your friends, you thought—were ready to murder you for it, you killed several of them in self-defense before you fled, leaving behind the only semblance of community you had. |
| 6  | **Witness:** You saw something you weren’t meant to see. They would kill you if they knew, and maybe they’re searching for you even now. You remain on the move, terrified of remaining in one place too long lest it all catch up to you. Perhaps if you make a big enough name for yourself, you can become untouchable and can finally speak of what you saw without fear. |

## CRIMINAL

You once worked as a bandit, insurgent, smuggler, outlaw, or even as an assassin. In defining your career, think about the following questions:

- What sorts of crimes did you commit, and why?
- Did anyone help you perform your illicit activities?
- What’s one crime that you botched?
- Who was your nemesis while you were a criminal?

You gain the following career benefits:

- **Skills:** The Criminal Underworld skill, plus two skills from the intrigue skill group.
- **Languages:** One language.
- **Project Points:** 120.
- **Perk:** One perk from the intrigue perk type.

### CRIMINAL INCITING INCIDENTS

| d3 | Incident |
|----|----------|
| 1  | **Atonement:** The last criminal job you pulled led to the death of someone or the destruction of something you love. In order to make up for the loss you caused, you left your criminal ways behind and became a hero. |
| 2  | **Friendly Priest:** You went to prison for your crimes and eventually escaped. An elderly priest took you in and shielded you from the law, convinced that your soul wasn’t corrupt. They never judged you for your past, speaking only of the future. Eventually, the priest died, imparting final words that inspired you to become a hero. |
| 3  | **Stand Against Tyranny:** When a tyrant rose to power in your homeland, they began cracking down on all criminals with deadly raids and public executions. The nature of the crime didn’t matter—pickpockets and beggars were made to kneel before the axe alongside murderers. After losing enough friends, you stood up and joined the resistance—not just against this tyrant, but against authoritarians anywhere. |

## DISCIPLE

You worked in a church, temple, or other religious institution as part of the clergy. In defining your career, think about the following questions:

- What gods or saints did your institution venerate?
- What initiation rites did you experience to get the job?
- What responsibilities did you have as a disciple?
- How did members of the culture where you worked view your institution?

You gain the following career benefits:

- **Skills:** The Religion skill, plus two skills from the lore skill group.
- **Project Points:** 240.
- **Perk:** One perk from the supernatural perk type.

### DISCIPLE INCITING INCIDENTS

| d6 | Incident |
|----|----------|
| 1  | (Blank?) |
| 2  | **Dogma:** Although you joined the religious institution under the guidance of a kind mentor, others within the house of worship became increasingly fanatical in their convictions. Your mentor sought to be a voice of reason in the rising tide of hatred and was tried as a heretic before being executed. Leaving the institution behind, you became a hero to uphold the beliefs you hold dear. |
| 3  | **Freedom to Worship:** Your temple was destroyed in a religious conflict. Leaders of the institution sought retaliation, but you saw in these actions a ceaseless cycle of destruction that would lead to more conflict. Instead, you became a hero to protect religious freedoms, so all worshipers could practice their faith without fear. |
| 4  | **Lost Faith:** You devoted your life to ministering to the sick and needy and other charitable work. Time and time again, travesty struck those you served without rhyme or reason. Your prayers went unanswered, and efforts went thankless. Eventually, you lost your faith in a higher power, and you left your church or temple to do good outside of any religious affiliation. |
| 5  | **Near Death Experience:** While serving at a religious institution, you almost died in an accident. When you woke, you lost all your memories of ever having worked for the church or temple. Though the clergy encouraged you to stay, you left to forge a new path. Your sense of altruism—whether instilled in you by your past work or a part of who you naturally are—guides you in your life. |
| 6  | **Taxing Times:** The faith-based organization that you were once part of became corrupt. It used its status in the community to accumulate wealth through tithes, and its leaders sought political appointments. During a season of drought, the institution stockpiled resources and refused to give aid, resulting in the death of many. You became a hero to fight against such corruption and to honor your dearly departed. |

## EXPLORER

You ventured into uncharted areas and made your living as a cartographer, researcher, or resource or treasure hunter. In defining your career, think about the following questions:

- For what purpose did you explore the unknown?
- Who else was part of your exploration team?
- What types of environments did you explore?
- What legend or rumor did you search for but never found?
- What is your greatest discovery?

You gain the following career benefits:

- **Skills:** The Navigate skill, plus two skills from the exploration skill group.
- **Languages:** Two languages.
- **Perk:** One perk from the exploration perk type.

### EXPLORER INCITING INCIDENTS

| d6 | Incident |
|----|----------|
| 1  | **Awakening:** In an uncharted area, you awakened some dark horror. You have turned to the life of a hero to put an end to the horror you unleashed and keep other hidden dangers at bay. |
| 2  | **Missing Piece:** You made an important but dangerous discovery about a treasure or ancient ritual that could spell mass destruction. Then the unthinkable happened. An unscrupulous colleague, spy, or treasure hunter stole your research notes. You’re looking for them and anyone else who might use such discoveries for ill. |
| 3  | **Nothing Belongs in a Museum:** Traversing seas and mountains to collect valuable artifacts for cultural institutions was once your way of life. When people died attempting to reclaim one of these objects you took, you realized the truth. Your work was part of a larger problem of misappropriation, and the best place for these significant objects was not in a museum but with the people who created them. You set out to return what had been taken and protect others from thievery. |
| 4  | **Unschooled:** You delved into dungeons and far-off places by studying them in books. You were an explorer who never felt the need to experience the dangers of your peers. Your theory about a lost world cost you your reputation. It gave you the impetus to set out on adventure and stand up for those with different ideas. |
| 5  | **Wanderlust:** As an explorer of new worlds, you saw yourself as an observer and operated with a code of conduct. You swore to never interfere with a group by exposing them to your technology, knowledge, or values. When faced with a moral conundrum, you either broke your code or stood idly by and suffered the consequences. During this incident, you lost your observation journal but became a hero who refuses to let evil stand unchecked. |
| 6  | **Wind in Your Sails:** As a sea-faring explorer, you lived to chart unknown courses. Though travel on the high seas was fraught with danger, the destination was always rewarding in riches, knowledge, or some other meaningful way to you. Your luck ran out when your ship was destroyed by pirates or other enemy forces. You have taken to protecting those who seek safe passage while also hoping to avenge your crew. |

## FARMER

You grew crops or cared for livestock. In defining your career, think about the following questions:

- Did you own the land where you farmed, or did you farm for another?
- What crops or livestock did you cultivate?
- Who else worked on the farm with you?
- What ill omen did you witness that caused you to have a poor season of farming?

You gain the following career benefits:

- **Skills:** The Handle Animal skill, plus two skills from the exploration skill group.
- **Languages:** One language.
- **Project Points:** 120.
- **Perk:** One perk from the exploration perk type.

### FARMER INCITING INCIDENTS

| d6 | Incident |
|----|----------|
| 1  | **Blight:** A horrible blight swept over the lands, sickening the livestock and causing the crops to rot. You don’t know whether it is of natural origin or something more malevolent, but you set out in search of a way to cleanse the land of this affliction. |
| 2  | **Bored:** You’ve always wanted so much more than gathering eggs and milking cows. You kept a secret journal of your dreams, filled with all the things you wanted. When your parent found the journal, they burned it and told you to keep your head out of the clouds. You gathered what you could in a pack and left everything else behind, seeking a life of adventure. |
| 3  | **Cursed:** While tilling your field, you found something in the dirt. Perhaps it was a chipped and dented weapon, a piece of ancient jewelry, or something altogether unique. Excited by your find, you showed it to a loved one, but when they touched it, something happened. You now know it was a curse conveyed by the item, though you don’t know why it affected them and not you. You left in search of answers. |
| 4  | **Hard Times:** Your farm had always been prosperous until the last few years. Changes in the weather caused smaller yields until you could no longer pay your tithe to the local noble. Her soldiers took what items of value they found, including a precious family heirloom. You left the struggling farm behind to find a better life. |
| 5  | **Razed:** Your animals were killed, your crops and home set ablaze. The culprits could have been bandits, a band of raiders from a nearby kingdom, or hired thugs sent by a rival farm. Whoever they were, they left you with nothing. You couldn’t face the thought of starting again from scratch. You took up a life of heroism to protect others from such villainy. |
| 6  | **Stolen:** Your family bred horses, beautiful creatures that were rivaled on the track and in the jousting lists by few. When a nearby noble arrived with an offer to buy your prized stallion, your father refused. The noble struck him down where he stood and stole the horse. Without that stallion, the renowned bloodline would end. You intend to get it back—and get revenge. |

## GLADIATOR

In the past, you entertained the masses with flashy displays of violence in the arena. In defining your career, think about the following questions:

- What led you to this life of violent entertainment?

### GLADIATOR INCITING INCIDENTS

| d3 | Incident |
|----|----------|
| 1  | **Betrayed:** A local crime lord offered you money to throw your last bout, promising that you’d live through the ordeal and get a cut of all the wagers placed on the match. You held up your end of the deal—which made the knife in your back after the loss so surprising. You woke in a shallow grave, barely alive, and ready to mete out justice. |
| 2  | **Heckler:** As you stood victorious on the arena sands, a voice cried out among the cheering. “This violence is just for show. You should be ashamed. There are people who need you—who need your skills!” Why did that voice ring so clear? And why did it sound so familiar? You never saw the face of the person who uttered the words, but they weighed heavy on you. The next day, you fled the arena to begin a hero’s life. |
| 3  | **New Challenges:** You earned every title you could. You beat every opponent willing to face you in the arena. Your final battle with your rival ended with you victorious—and yet you were unsatisfied. There are other, greater foes out there, and you mean to find them. |

## LABORER

You worked as a farmer, a builder, a clothes washer, a lumberjack, a miner, or some other profession engaged in hard manual labor. In defining your career, think about the following questions:

- What type of manual labor did you do?
- What important friendship did you make on the job?
- Where did you go with your coworkers to blow off steam when the job was done?
- What aspect of the job was most difficult for you?

You gain the following career benefits:

- **Skills:** The Endurance skill, plus choose any two skills from Blacksmithing or the skills of the exploration skill group.
- **Languages:** One language.
- **Project Points:** 120.
- **Perk:** One perk from the exploration perk type.

### LABORER INCITING INCIDENTS

| d3 | Incident |
|----|----------|
| 1  | **Disaster:** A disaster, such as a cave-in, wildfire, or tidal wave, hit your crew while you were working. You saved as many folks as you could, but the ones you couldn’t save weigh heavily on your mind. You took up the life of a hero to save as many people as possible, vowing that what happened to you won’t happen again. |
| 2  | **Embarrassment:** A noble you worked for admonished you publicly for work done poorly—more than once. Finally, you had enough. You vowed to take up a new path and show this noble that you are far more than what they make you out to be. |
| 3  | **Live the Dream:** You worked with a good friend, and on the job, you’d always fantasize about what it’d be like to hit the road as adventuring heroes—someday. You didn’t count on your friend falling ill and passing away. Now it’s time to live out that dream for both of you. |

## MAGE'S APPRENTICE

For long years, you studied magic under the mentorship of a more experienced mage. In defining your career, think about the following questions:

- Who did you study under, and what kind of person were they?
- What were your mentor’s areas of expertise?
- What aspects of magic did you struggle to comprehend?
- What is your current relationship with your mentor?

You gain the following career benefits:

- **Skills:** The Magic skill, plus two skills from the lore skill group.
- **Languages:** One language.
- **Renown:** 1.
- **Perk:** One perk from the supernatural perk type.

### MAGE'S APPRENTICE INCITING INCIDENTS

| d3 | Incident |
|----|----------|
| 1  | **Oops:** While studying magic, you accidentally sent yourself from your original world to this one. Now you’re stranded here, hoping to get back home by finding ancient texts or powerful magical treasures that might transport you there. A life of adventure it is! |
| 2  | **Ultimate Power:** The mage you worked for was a kindly old soul, but the basic magic they taught you always seemed like a small part of something bigger. It wasn’t until you met an adventuring elementalist that you realized hitting the road as a hero was the only way to truly improve and hone your skills. You resigned your apprenticeship and found yourself walking the path of a hero the next day. |
| 3  | **Missing Mage:** One day you woke up and the mage you worked for was just gone. They didn’t take any of their belongings, and there was no sign of any foul play—just the scent of sulfur in their bedchamber. You set out on your heroic journey in the aftermath and have been looking for them ever since. |

## PERFORMER

You can sing, act, or dance well enough that people actually pay to see you do it. Imagine that! In defining your career, think about the following questions:

- What is the tone of your performances?
- What song, role, or dance are you most known for?
- Did you perform in the same place throughout your career, or did you travel?
- Were you part of a troupe, or were you a solo act?

You gain the following career benefits:

- **Skills:** The Music or Performance skill, plus two skills from the interpersonal skill group.
- **Renown:** +2.

### PERFORMER INCITING INCIDENTS

| d3 | Incident |

| 1  | **Cursed Audience:** During a performance, you watched in horror as the audience was suddenly overcome by a curse that caused them to disintegrate before your eyes. You’re not sure what happened, but seeking that answer quickly led you to places where only heroes dare to go. |
| 2  | **Fame and Fortune:** You thought you were famous—then that hero came to your show. Suddenly, all eyes were on the dragon-slaying brute instead of the stage where they belonged. The audience even gave them a standing ovation when they entered the room. All you got was polite applause. Fine. If people want a hero, then a hero you shall be. |
| 3  | **Tragic Lesson:** When a producer who once shortchanged you shouted out on the street for you to stop a thief who had picked their pocket, your spite toward the producer inspired you to let the thief run right on by. But that decision led to tragedy when the thief later harmed someone you loved. From that moment on, you decided to make it your responsibility to protect others. |

- Who were you responsible for ruling or representing?

You gain the following career benefits:

## POLITICIAN INCITING INCIDENTS

| d6 | Incident |
|----|----------|
| 1  | **Diplomatic Immunity:** Your political power allowed you to be foolish without consequence. Through sheer carelessness or on a dare, you accidentally harmed or killed an innocent bystander. Due to your position as an official, you faced no consequences. This event was the final straw for the one who you loved or respected most, and they turned away from you. You left the world of political machinations behind to earn back their trust. |
| 2  | **Insurrectionist:** You created a charitable foundation to secretly fund a rebel organization intent on overthrowing the corrupt establishment. Someone close to you discovered your treason, and you were forced to leave or risk execution. You became a hero to live and fight another day on behalf of those who have no power. |
| 3  | **Respected Consul:** You were seneschal to a monarch or other leader, able to sway their opinions. Your proximity to power made you popular. Gossip convinced the monarch you were plotting an overthrow, and you were ousted from court. You became a hero to continue your work making meaningful change in the world. |
| 4  | **Right Side of History:** You tried to work on policy change from the inside of a bureaucratic organization. There were others like you who were more vocal. You started to notice those colleagues were disappearing overnight. Not wanting to find out if you were next on the list, you left to enact change in more direct ways. |
| 5  | **Self-Serving:** You used your skills to collect incriminating or scandalous information about your opponents to blackmail them. A rival got one step ahead of you and stole your book of dirty secrets, but instead of using it against you, they gave you an opportunity to leave the world of politics behind. Saved from public humiliation, you now use your skills for the greater good. |
| 6  | **Unbound:** If the paperwork and circuitous systems were not soul-crushing enough, the red tape required to get anything done through your political position resulted in a crisis being mishandled and countless lives harmed or lost. After that unfortunate event, you were determined to be unfettered by bureaucratic interference and sought to do good through action, not paperwork. |

| d3 | Incident |
|----|----------|
| 1  | **Bookish Ideas:** You were always content to live a peaceful life in your library until you found that one book—the one that told the tale of heroes who had saved the timescape. They didn’t spend their days behind a desk. They made a real difference. It was time for you to do the same. |
| 2  | **Cure the Curse:** You used to think knowledge could fix everything. You were wrong. When someone you loved fell under a curse, the means to cure them couldn’t be found in any of the books you owned. But that wasn’t going to stop you. The answers are out there, and you’ll find them even if you need to face down death to do so. |
| 3  | **Lost Library:** An evil mage took all your books for themself, cackling at your impotence as they raided your shelves. Now you’re off to search through ancient ruins and secret libraries to rebuild your collection of rare tomes—and to find the mage who stole from you. |

## SAILOR

You worked on a boat that might have been a merchant, mercenary, military, or pirate vessel. You may have been a deckhand, mate, or even the captain. In defining your career, think about the following questions:

### SAILOR INCITING INCIDENTS

| d6 | Incident |
|----|----------|
| 1  | **Alone:** You joined up with your best friend, sibling, or other loved one, the culmination of a lifelong dream to sail the high seas together. When they died, you lost your taste for the seafaring life. You left at the first chance you got and haven’t looked back. |
| 2  | **Deserter:** It was in the middle of a raid when you realized you no longer believed in a life of piracy. You used the chaos of the moment to slip away unnoticed. You now work as a hero in an effort to atone for your past deeds and fear the day your old crew finds you. |
| 3  | **Forgotten:** You awoke aboard your ship with no memory of who you had been before. Though the other sailors insisted they knew you, you didn’t know them. The next time you went ashore, you decided to stay, determined to find out who you really are. |
| 4  | **Jealousy:** You had the favor of your captain, a fact that earned you many rivals aboard your ship. One night, your fellow sailors pulled you from your bunk and threw you overboard. By some miracle, you were scooped from the waters by a passing vessel. You worked off your debt to them, then set out on a new life with less pettiness. |
| 5  | **Marooned:** There was a mutiny, and you were on the wrong side. You were marooned on an island and escaped when a merchant vessel got blown off course by a storm and found you. Your reputation is ruined among sailors, so you seek adventure elsewhere. |
| 6  | **Water Fear:** A catastrophic storm hit while you were at sea, destroying the ship and leaving you as the only survivor. Once you recovered, you tried to sign on with another ship, but the thought of the open water turns your legs to jelly. Instead, you’ve taken on the role of traveling hero to make ends meet. |

## SOLDIER

In your formative years, you fought tirelessly in skirmishes and campaigns against enemy forces. In defining your career, think about the following questions:

### SOLDIER INCITING INCIDENTS

| d3 | Incident |
|----|----------|
| 1  | **Dishonorable Discharge:** You enlisted in the military to protect others, but your commander ordered you to beat and kill civilians. When you refused, things got violent. You barely escaped the brawl that ensued, but now you vow to help people on your own terms. |
| 2  | **Out of Retirement:** You had a long and storied career as a soldier before deciding to retire to a simpler life. But when you returned to your old home, you found that your enemies had laid waste to it. Now the skills you earned on the battlefield are helping you as you become a different kind of warrior, seeking to save others from the fate you suffered. |
| 3  | **Sole Survivor:** You were the last surviving member of your unit after an arduous battle or monstrous assault, surviving only because of your luck. You turned away from the life of a soldier then, seeking to become a hero who could stand against such threats. |

## WARDEN

You protected a wild region from those who seek to harm it, such as poachers and cultists bent on the destruction of the natural world. You also knew your land well and could serve as a guide or leader of rescue parties for those wandering the wilds. In defining your career, think about the following questions:

- What environment did you protect?
- Were you part of a formal group of wardens, or did you take the job upon yourself?

- **Project Points:** 120.

### WARDEN INCITING INCIDENTS

| d6 | Incident |
|----|----------|
| 1  | **Betrayed:** When outsiders arrived in your lands with the intent to exploit the land for its resources, you naturally spoke out against them. However, several other wardens spoke in favor of these outsiders and allowed them in to rip the land’s resources. Refusing to watch your homeland destroyed, you left. Now you help others avoid such a fate. |
| 2  | **Corruption:** A disease has infected your grove. The infection causes animals to become violent, and it twists the plants into something dark and sinister. You’ve tried everything, magical and mundane, to stop it, but it continues to spread. You’ve set out in search of a cure or an unblighted land to protect. |
| 3  | **Exiled:** You made a mistake that could not be forgiven. The other wardens of the region decided your fate, casting you from your lands with an order never to return. |
| 4  | **Honor the Fallen:** A group of heroes arrived in your land with trouble close on their heels. You fought with them to turn back the evil, but it was too much. The heroes fell, and your land was forever altered. Though your lands are beyond saving, there are other lands you can help. |
| 5  | **Portents:** There were signs. You tried to ignore them, but when a great beast died at your feet, you had to recognize the truth. You were meant to leave, meant to fight a battle for the fate of all the lands. You gave up the only home you’ve ever known. |
| 6  | **Theft:** You were responsible for guarding something precious, something vital to your region’s survival. You let someone in, and they betrayed your trust by stealing the thing you were meant to guard. You left your lands to atone for your mistake. |

## WATCH OFFICER

You served as an officer of the law for a local government. You might have been a single person in a much larger city watch or the only constable patrolling a small village. In defining your career, think about the following questions:

- What type of settlement did you protect?
- What was your law enforcement style like? Were you a by-the-book officer, a totally corrupt cop, or a more lenient but fair type?
- What criminal to this day has still eluded your grasp?
- Whose life did you save while in the line of duty?
- What is the most absurd call you ever responded to, and how did you handle it?

You gain the following career benefits:

- **Skills:** Alertness, plus two skills from the intrigue skill group.
- **Languages:** Two languages.
- **Perk:** One perk from the exploration perk type.

### WATCH OFFICER INCITING INCIDENTS

| d6 | Incident |
|----|----------|
| 2  | **Corruption Within:** You joined the force to help the helpless and bring justice to those wronged. You weren’t prepared for the rampant corruption reaching the top of your organization. You refused to cover for your fellow officers and were told in no simple terms to leave town or face the consequences. Now you travel as a hero, acting as the protector you always wanted to be. |
| 3  | **Frame Job:** Your partner was murdered. That’s irrefutable. But you didn’t do it, despite what the evidence implies. When it became clear you would take the fall, you fled, leaving everything behind. Not content to cower in the shadows, you decided to adventure under a new name while you work to clear your own. |
| 4  | **Missing Mentor:** You learned everything you know about the job from someone you always looked up to in a corrupt organization. One night, they sent you a cryptic message that they’d discovered “something big,” but before you found out more, they disappeared. No longer sure who you could trust, you slipped away and sought a new life. Now you do what good you can and search to find the truth. |
| 5  | **One that Got Away:** A particularly violent or depraved criminal evaded your grasp and then began targeting you—perhaps they stole something personal or hurt someone you love—before slipping through your grasp again. You left to pursue the criminal, but the trail has gone cold… for now. Might as well help folks in the meantime. |
| 6  | **Powerful Enemies:** You made it your responsibility to root out and bring down the region’s foremost crime syndicate. They sent goons to burn down your home and teach you a lesson. They left you bleeding in the street, with nothing left except your life. You’ve taken on the life of a hero to gain the power and influence you need to destroy the syndicate once and for all. |

# CLASSES

(Playtest note: Introduction to come.)

Your class provides you with most of your abilities. For details on the ability format, see Abilities.

# CENSOR

Demons and devils fear you. Criminals run from the sight of your shadow in the alley. Agents of chaos, blasphemers, and heretics tremble at the sound of your voice. You carry the power of the gods, armed with judgements and sent out into the world first to seek, then censor those whose actions or even existence is anathema to your church.

You’re at your best against the strongest foes. Your judgments terrify heretics, stop enemies in their tracks, even hurl them across the battlefield.

## BASICS

- **Starting Characteristics:** You start with a Might of 2 and a Presence of 2, and can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristic scores:
  - 2, -1, -1

- **Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 21

|-------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------|-----------|

## 1ST-LEVEL FEATURES

As a censor, you gain the following features:

### ORDER

Censors are the will of their god made physically manifest in the world.

Choose one of the following orders. Your choice determines your Order features and Order triggered action in addition to several features you get at later levels.

- **Exorcist:** An open mind is an unguarded fortress. You specialize in hunting the hidden enemies of your order. You gain the Read Person skill.
- **Oracle:** Corruption has deep tendrils that can be missed. You specialize in uncovering long-time scale threats to your order. You gain the Magic skill.
- **Paragon:** Without a strong example and a firm hand, the weak will be corrupted. You specialize in setting a visible example for your holy order. You gain the Lead skill.

### DEITY AND DOMAINS

Choose a god or saint who you revere from the Conduit Deities table or ask your Director about the deities in your campaign world. With the Director’s permission, you can also create your own deity and can choose four domains to be part of their portfolio.

After choosing your deity, pick one domain from their portfolio. Your choice of domains determines some of the features you’ll gain from this class.

(Playtest note: More gods and saints are coming, along with their descriptions.)

#### CENSOR DEITIES

| Deity  | Domains                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| Adun   | Love, Protection, Storm, War     |
| Cavall | Knowledge, Protection, Sun, War  |
| Cyrvis | Fate, Death, Nature, Trickery    |
| Malus  | Creation, Fate, Life, Knowledge  |
| Salorna| Death, Nature, Storm, Sun        |
| Viras  | Creation, Life, Love, Trickery   |

### JUDGMENT

The power you serve grants you access to judgements with which you censor those your church deems heretics. Judgment is your Heroic Resource.

#### JUDGEMENT IN COMBAT

When a combat encounter (or other stressful situation tracked in rounds as determined by the Director) begins, you gain judgement equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 judgement. The first time in a round that a creature judged by you deals damage to another creature, you generate and bank 1 judgment on them. When combat ends, you lose all your judgement.

Abilities that target a judged creature can only target a creature with at least 1 judgment banked on them.

#### JUDGEMENT OUTSIDE OF COMBAT

Though you can’t gain judgment outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost judgment without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs judgment outside of combat, you can’t use that same ability or effect again outside of combat until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability that lets you spend unlimited piety on its effect out of combat, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of piety on it equal to your Victories.

#### WRATH

- **Fear my wrath!**
  - **Keywords:** Magic, Ranged
  - **Type:** Maneuver
  - **Distance:** Ranged 10
  - **Target:** 1 enemy
  - **Effect:** You bank 1 or more judgment on the target. While a creature has at least 1 judgment on it, any targets they attack gain ���.

Each judgment banked on the judged creature increases the effectiveness of your censor abilities, indicated on your order’s judgment type table below. A creature stays judged until the end of the encounter while they have any judgment on them.

When using a heroic ability that targets a creature with judgment banked, you can spend banked judgment on that creature to use the ability.

When the judged creature is reduced to 0 Stamina or otherwise removes the judgment, you can use a free triggered action to take the judgment banked on the judged creature and move it to a new target within distance. Any judgment you do not bank on this new target is returned to you.

When you bank judgment on a creature, you also gain one of the following benefits based on your order:

- **Exorcist:** You teleport a distance equal to twice your Presence score. This movement must take you closer to the judged target. You do not need line of effect for this movement.
- **Oracle:** You deal � holy damage to the target and each enemy within 2 squares of the target.
- **Paragon:** You pull the target up to a number of squares equal to twice your Presence score.

Choose a god or saint who you revere from the Conduit Deities table, or ask your Director about the deities in your campaign world. With the Director’s permission, you can also create your own deity, and can choose four domains to be part of their portfolio.  

After choosing your deity, pick two domains from their portfolio. Your choice of domains determines many of the features you’ll gain from this class.  

> *Playtest note: More gods and saints are coming, along with their descriptions.*

#### CONDUIT DEITIES

| Deity  | Domains                          |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| Adun   | Love, Protection, Storm, War     |
| Cavall | Knowledge, Protection, Sun, War  |
| Cyrvis | Fate, Death, Nature, Trickery    |
| Malus  | Creation, Fate, Life, Knowledge  |
| Salorna| Death, Nature, Storm, Sun        |
| Viras  | Creation, Life, Love, Trickery   |

### PIETY

Your deity grants you a Heroic Resource called piety to fuel your abilities. You use piety to heal and empower your allies, and to unleash your deity’s power upon your foes.

#### PIETY IN COMBAT

When a combat encounter (or other stressful situation tracked in rounds as determined by the Director) begins, you gain piety equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 piety.  

Additionally, you can gain more piety by praying to the gods when you roll to gain piety, but beware. Praying to the gods can easily draw their ire! They hate to be annoyed. When you roll to gain piety, you can pray to the gods and gain the additional effects (no action required):  

- If your piety roll is a 1, you gain 1 additional piety but anger the gods! You take 1d6 + your level psychic damage, which can’t be reduced in any way.  
- If your piety roll is a 2, you gain 1 additional piety.  
- If your piety roll is a 3, you gain 2 additional piety and you can activate a domain effect of your choice.  

Your piety disappears at the end of the encounter.

#### PIETY OUTSIDE OF COMBAT

Though you can’t gain piety outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost piety without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs piety outside of combat, you can’t use that same ability or effect again outside of combat until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.  

If you use an ability that lets you spend unlimited piety on its effect, such as Healing Grace, out of combat, you can use it...

it as if you had spent an amount of piety on it equal to your Victories.

## 1ST-LEVEL FEATURES

As an elementalist, you gain the following features.

### ELEMENTAL SPECIALIZATION

Through your studies, you know and can manipulate the seven primal elements of the timescape:  

- **Air** is the element of movement. Air abilities allow you to manipulate speed, quickness, flight, and breath.  
- **Earth** is the element of permanence. Earth abilities create and shape physical terrain in a permanent way, and bolster the strength and hardiness of allies.  
- **Fire** is the element of destruction. Fire abilities harm enemies and objects.  
- **Green** is the element of creation and growth. Green abilities make and manipulate plants, fungi, and other forms of life to hamper foes and nourish your allies.  
- **Rot** is the element of death. Rot abilities decay and debuff enemies.  
- **Void** is the element of the unknown. Void abilities warp space and reality, allowing you to teleport, create illusions, and make things incorporeal.  
- **Water** is the element of change. Water abilities enhance what your allies can do, and alter the abilities of your enemies for the worse.  

Choose one of the following elements to be your specialty: earth, fire, green, or void. (Other elemental specializations will be featured in future products.) Your choice of specialization determines many of the features you’ll gain from this class, including one of the benefits below.

#### ACOLYTE OF EARTH

You gain this feature if earth is your specialization. When earth magic flows through you, you know how to harness it to become harder to move. When you use a magic ability that has the Earth keyword, your Stability increases by 1 until the start of your next turn.

#### ACOLYTE OF FIRE

You gain this feature if fire is your specialization. You are an expert at wielding destructive flames. When you deal damage with a magic ability that has the Fire keyword, you deal an additional 1 damage.

#### ACOLYTE OF THE GREEN

You gain this feature if green is your specialization. You can harness the residual magic from your green spells to bolster yourself and your allies. When you deal damage to at least one creature with a magic ability that has the Green keyword and costs essence to use, you or a creature of your choice within 10 squares of you gains Temporary Stamina equal to your Reason score. This temporary stamina disappears at the end of the encounter.

#### ACOLYTE OF THE MYSTERY

You gain this feature if void is your specialization. You are immersed in the mystery of void magic and can hold onto it longer than other mages. The distance of all your magic abilities with the Void and Ranged keywords increases by 5.

### ESSENCE

You channel the substance of creation in the form of a Heroic Resource called essence. In times of great stress, you can focus your control on this substance, gathering and burning it to cast and maintain spells.

#### ESSENCE IN COMBAT

When combat begins, gain essence equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 essence. When combat ends, you lose all of your essence.

#### ESSENCE OUTSIDE OF COMBAT

Though you can’t gain essence outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost essence without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs essence outside of combat, you can’t use that same ability or effect again outside of combat until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.  
If you use a persistent ability outside of combat (see Persistent Magic), you can maintain it for a number of rounds equal to your Victories outside of combat.  
If you use an ability that lets you spend unlimited essence on its effect out of combat, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of essence on it equal to your Victories.

### HURL ELEMENT

You gain the following ability, which can be used as a ranged free strike:

#### HURL ELEMENT

*You cast a ball of elemental energy at a nearby foe.*  
- **Keywords:** Attack, Magic, Ranged  
- **Type:** Action  
- **Distance:** Ranged 10  
- **Target:** 1 creature or object  

**Power Roll + Reason:**  
- 11 or lower: 2 damage  
- 12–16: 4 damage  
- 17+: 6 damage  

**Effect:** When you make this attack, choose the damage type from one of the following options: acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic.

### PERSISTENT MAGIC

Some of your heroic abilities have a persistent effect entry, like *Instantaneous Excavation*, which has an effect noted as “Persistent 1.” Whenever you use a persistent ability, you decide whether you want to maintain it and start doing so immediately after you first use the ability. If you maintain a persistent ability in combat, you reduce the amount of essence you earn at the start of your turn by an amount equal to the ability’s persistent value, which enables the ability’s persistent effect. All your active persistent abilities end when combat ends.  
You can’t maintain any abilities that would make you earn a negative amount of essence at the start of your turn or have a negative amount of essence outside of combat. You can stop maintaining an ability at any time (no action required).  

If you maintain the same ability on several targets and the effect includes a power roll, you make that roll once and apply the same effect to all targets. A creature can’t be affected by multiple instances of a persistent ability.  
If you take damage equal to 5 × your Reason score in one turn, you stop maintaining any persistent abilities. For example, if you have a Reason score of 2 and are maintaining *Instantaneous Excavation* and take 10 or more damage in one turn, you stop maintaining the ability.

### PRACTICAL MAGIC

You have the following ability:

#### PRACTICAL MAGIC

*Your mastery of elemental power lets you customize your conjurations.*  

- **Keywords:** Magic  
- **Type:** Maneuver  
- **Distance:** Self  
- **Target:** Self  

**Effect:** Choose one of the following effects:  
- You use the Knockback maneuver, but you make a Reason ability power roll instead of a Might ability power roll. For this use of the maneuver, you can target a creature at a distance equal to the distance of your *Hurl Element* ability.  
- You choose a creature within the distance of your *Hurl Element* ability and deal 1 surge damage to them. The damage type can be acid, cold, corruption, fire, lightning, poison, or sonic.  
- You teleport a number of squares equal to your Reason score.

### 1ST-LEVEL SPECIALIZATION FEATURE

Your elementalist specialization grants you a feature, as shown on the 1st-Level Elementalist Specialization Features table.

#### 1ST-LEVEL ELEMENTALIST SPECIALIZATION FEATURES

#### A BEYONDING OF VISION

You instantly recognize illusions for what they are, you can see invisible creatures, and supernatural effects can’t conceal creatures and objects from you. You always know if an area or object you observe is magical or affected by magic, and the specifics of what that magic can do.

#### IT IS THE SOUL WHICH HEARS
You can speak with and understand Animals, Plant Creatures, and Monstrosities, even if they don’t share a language with you. Your ability to communicate with such creatures doesn’t make them inherently more intelligent, but you can use Reason in place of Presence while making a Presence test to influence them.

While in these forms, you can speak, and you use your Reason score to make melee free strikes. Other than exceptions noted in this description and on the table, your statistics remain the same.

When you make this change, you decide which pieces of your equipment meld into your new form or fall unharmed to the ground. When you change back, melded gear reappears on your person.  

You can revert back to your true form as a maneuver. You can’t enter an animal form unless you are in your true form. If you are dying, you revert to your true form and can’t turn back into an animal until you are no longer dying.

If an enemy is forced moved into the portal, their forced movement ends and they emerge from the other portal in an unoccupied space of your choice.

**Persistent 0:** If the portals are within distance at the start of your next turn, they remain open until the start of your next turn.

# FURY

You do not temper the heat of battle within you, you unleash it! Like a raptor, a panther, a wolf, your experience in the wild taught you the secret of channeling unfettered anger into martial prowess. Primordial chaos is your ally. Leave it to others to use finesse to clean up the pieces you leave behind.

As a fury, you have abilities that deal a lot of damage, move you around the battlefield, and grow in strength as your rage increases. Nature has no concept of fairness—and neither do you.

## BASICS

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with a Might of 2 and an Agility of 2, and can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristics scores:
- 2, -1, -1

## 1ST-LEVEL FEATURES

As a fury, you gain the following features.

### PRIMORDIAL ASPECT

You come from a tradition older than civilization, older than warfare, older than most of the world. You have undergone a rite of passage that revealed the building blocks of the Timescape—the Primordial Chaos—and which left an aspect of the Primordial Chaos inside you. As you channel the rage that shapes you, you can choose a primordial aspect from the following:

- **Berserker:** You channel your rage into expressions of physical might, acting as a living version of the forces that reshape the world. You gain the Lift skill.
- **Reaver:** You channel your rage into instinct and cunning, challenging the false order of civilization. You gain the Hide skill.
- **Stormwight:** You channel your rage into the form of animals and primordial storms. You gain the Track skill.

Your choice of primordial aspect determines many of the features you’ll gain from this class.

### RAGE

As the battle intensifies around you, your determination and anger grow, fueling a Heroic Resource called rage.

#### RAGE IN COMBAT

When a combat encounter begins, you gain rage equal to your Victories. At the start of each turn of combat, you gain 1d3 rage. The first time in a round that you take damage, you gain 1 rage. Your rage disappears at the end of the encounter.

#### RAGE OUTSIDE OF COMBAT

Though you can’t gain rage outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost rage without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs rage outside of combat, you can’t use that same ability or effect again outside of combat until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability that lets you spend unlimited rage on its effect, such as *To the Uttermost End*, out of combat, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of rage on it equal to your Victories.

### GROWING RAGE

You gain certain benefits in combat based on the amount of rage you have. See Aspect Features for details. The benefits from your growing rage last until the end of your turn, even if a benefit would become unavailable to you because of the amount of rage you spend during your turn.

### MIGHTY LEAPS

You always succeed on Might tests made to jump. You can still roll to see if you get a reward result.

### WHERE'S MY MANEUVER?

Since most other classes get a bespoke maneuver, during playtesting many folks asked, "Where is the fury's special maneuver?" The fury doesn’t need a maneuver all their own because most of the time we’ve found that the fantasy of the fury has them using the **Knockback** or **Grab** maneuvers in combat. They’re really good at it too, so it doesn’t make sense to give you another option that you'll rarely or never use.

# NULL

The mind is not separate from the body. Perfection of one requires perfection of the other. You strive for perfect discipline, perfect order, mastery over mind and body. You require no weapons, no tools. Any tool can be turned against the hand that wields it. You suffice.

As you strive for perfect order, you become an enemy of that ultimate expression of chaos: Magic. Those who employ sorcery or psionics to break the laws of nature should fear you.

The null is an unarmed psionic warrior who dampens and absorbs the effects of magic and psionics. You need no weapon because you are the weapon. Your Heroic Resource is discipline. Play a null if you want to resist the supernatural forces of the universe with expert calm and confidence.

## BASICS

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with an Agility of 2 and an Intuition of 2, and can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristics scores:

- 2, -1, -1

### 1ST-LEVEL FEATURES

### TRADITIONS

Nulls have learned to unlock the full psionic potential of their bodies through extensive physical training. Where a talent has mastery of the mind, the null has mastery of the body.

Choose one of the following traditions. Your choice determines your tradition features and tradition triggered action in addition to several features you get at later levels.

- **Chronokinetic:** Your training has allowed you to become unmoored from time, using the flow of time as another dimension that all things move through. You gain a lore skill.

Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs discipline outside of combat, you can’t use that same ability or effect again outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability that lets you spend unlimited discipline on its effect out of combat, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of discipline on it equal to your Victories.

### 1ST-LEVEL FEATURES  

As a shadow, you gain the following features.  

#### SHADOW COLLEGE  

Shadow colleges are secret institutions that turn ordinary folk into something else. Finding a college is the first step in a rigorous initiation process that tests the mettle of an applicant. Even those who make the cut often wash out—or are kicked out—as the master shadows who teach stealth, magic, and assassination to their students are often less than gentle in their approach.

You are one of the few who has graduated from a shadow college, chosen from the following options:  

- **College of Black Ash:** The College of Black Ash founded the art of being a shadow. Its graduates use Black Ash sorcery to teleport around the battlefield in clouds of soot, and to manipulate and create darkness. Graduates of the college are unmatched in mobility. You gain the Magic skill.  
- **College of Caustic Alchemy:** The College of Caustic Alchemy teaches its students recipes for the acids, bombs, and poisons used in their grim work. Graduates of the college are exceptional assassins. You gain the Alchemy skill.  
- **College of the Harlequin Mask:** Graduates of the College of the Harlequin Mask learn illusion magic, which they use to infiltrate enemy strongholds and create orchestrated chaos in combat. You gain the Lie skill.  

Your choice of shadow college determines many of the features you’ll gain from this class.  

### INSIGHT  

By observing your enemy, you learn how to use their weaknesses against them. You have a Heroic Resource called insight.  

#### INSIGHT IN COMBAT  

When combat begins, gain insight equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 1d3 insight. Additionally, the first time each round that you deal damage with an ability that has a power roll and at least one �, you gain 1 insight.

When combat ends, you lose all of your insight.  

Your heroic abilities that have a power roll cost 1 less insight for each edge you have on the ability power roll (maximum of 2). If the ability has multiple targets, the cost is reduced by the highest amount of edges you have that applies to one target. Banes don’t subtract from edges for the purpose of reducing the insight cost of heroic abilities.  

#### INSIGHT OUTSIDE OF COMBAT  

Though you can’t gain insight outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost insight without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs insight outside of combat, you can’t use that same ability or effect again outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability that lets you spend unlimited insight on its effect, such as Black Ash Teleport, out of combat, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of insight on it equal to your Victories.

While this illusion lasts, you gain an edge and � on attacks against the creature’s allies.

TACTICIAN
===========

Strategist. Defender. Leader. With sword in hand, you lead allies into the maw of battle, barking out commands that inspire your fellow heroes to move faster and strike more precisely. All the while, you stand between your compatriots and death, taunting the followers of evil to best you if they can.

| 2nd   | Battlefield Awareness, Doctrine Features, Perk, Doctrine Ability | 3, 5 | 5 |
| 3rd   | Out of Position, Focus Ability | 3, 5, 7 | 5 |

1ST-LEVEL FEATURES
-------------------

As a tactician, you gain the following features:

### TACTICAL DOCTRINE

Warfare is as old as civilization—and perhaps even older. As battle became ever more developed and complex, military leaders invented doctrine, outlining how combatants should be structured, used, and deployed. Doctrine can be learned at war colleges passing on ancient martial traditions, or directly through blood and sweat on the battlefield.

You have developed a mastery of tactics of historical significance, letting you choose one of the following doctrines:

- **Vanguard (Shock and Awe):** You have learned the tactics and stratagems of the heroes of ancient history, letting you lead from the front lines of battle and seek victory through sheer force of will and personality. You gain a skill from the interpersonal skill group.
- **Mastermind (Grand Strategy):** You have an encyclopedic knowledge of warfare, viewing the battlefield as a game board, and seeking victory by thinking multiple steps ahead of your opponents. You gain a skill from the lore skill group.
- **Insurgent (Asymmetric Warfare):** Doing your duty, playing fair, and dying honorably in battle is your opponent’s job. By contrast, you’ll do whatever it takes to keep your allies alive. You gain a skill from the intrigue skill group.

Your choice of doctrine determines many of the features you’ll gain from this class.

### FOCUS

The ring of steel panics others but brings order to your mind, granting you a Heroic Resource called focus.

#### FOCUS IN COMBAT

When a combat encounter begins, you gain focus equal to your Victories. At the start of your turn in combat, you gain 2 focus. The first time in a round an ally attacks a target you have marked, you gain 1 focus. When combat ends, your focus drops to 0.

#### FOCUS OUTSIDE OF COMBAT

Though you can’t gain focus outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost focus without spending it. Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs focus outside of combat, you can’t use that same ability or effect again outside of combat again until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability that lets you spend unlimited discipline on its effect out of combat, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of focus on it equal to your Victories.

1ST-LEVEL TACTICAL DOCTRINE FEATURES
======================================

### Doctrine Feature

| Doctrine    | Feature               |
|-------------|------------------------|
| Vanguard    | Commanding Presence   |
| Mastermind  | Studied Commander     |
| Insurgent   | Covert Operations     |

### COMMANDING PRESENCE

You command any room you walk into. While you are present, each hero with you is treated as having a Renown 2 higher than usual for the purpose of negotiations and influencing tests. Additionally, each hero with you has a double edge on tests made to stop combat and start a negotiation with the other side.

### COVERT OPERATIONS

While in your presence or working according to your plans, each of your allies gains an edge on tests with any skill from the intrigue skill group. Additionally, you can use the Lead skill to assist on any test made with a skill from the intrigue skill group. At the Director’s discretion, you and your allies can use skills from the intrigue skill group to attempt research or reconnaissance during a negotiation instead of outside of negotiation.

### STUDIED COMMANDER

Your encyclopedic knowledge of the history of battle lets you apply that knowledge to current challenges. While you are with them, any hero treats the Discover Lore project related to a war or battle as one category cheaper, with projects seeking common lore becoming free, but still requiring a respite activity to complete. (See Research and Crafting in future packets for more information.)

### DOCTRINE TRIGGERED ACTION

Your doctrine grants you a triggered action, as shown on the Tactician Triggered Actions table.

| Doctrine    | Triggered Action  |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Vanguard    | Parry             |
| Mastermind  | Overwatch         |
| Insurgent   | Dirty Tricks      |

### ADVANCED TACTICS

Your leadership thwarts an enemy or aids an ally.  

**Keywords:** Ranged  
**Type:** Triggered  
**Distance:** Ranged 10  
**Target:** Any creature  
**Trigger:** The target makes an attack against another creature.  
**Effect:** Add or subtract � to the attack.  
**Spend 3 Focus:** Increase or decrease the potency of one effect from the attack.

### PARRY

Your quick reflexes cost an enemy the precision they seek.  

**Keywords:** Melee, Weapon  
**Type:** Triggered  
**Distance:** Self or Melee 1  
**Target:** Self or 1 ally  
**Trigger:** A creature makes a Weapon attack against the target.  
**Effect:** The attack’s damage is reduced ������.  
**Spend 3 Focus:** Decrease the potency of all effects on the attack by 1.

### OVERWATCH

Under your direction, an ally waits for just the right moment to strike.  

**Keywords:** Ranged  
**Type:** Triggered  
**Distance:** Ranged 10  
**Target:** 1 enemy  
**Trigger:** The target moves.  
**Effect:** At any point during the target’s movement, one ally can make a free strike against the target.  
**Spend 1 Focus:** The target is also R [average] slowed.

### FIELD ARSENAL

You have drilled with a broad array of weapons and have developed techniques to optimize their use. Whenever you select or change your kit, you can select an additional martial kit and gain the benefits of both kits. (See Kits.)

If both kits grant you the same benefit, you take one or the other and can’t change your choice until you finish a Respite. (This usually means taking the higher of two bonuses.) You also gain access to the signature abilities of both kits.

For example, if you take the Shining Armor and Sniper kits, you gain the following benefits overall:
- **Stamina Bonus:** +12
- **Stability Bonus:** +1
- **Melee Weapon Damage Bonus:** +2/+2/+2
- **Speed Bonus:** +1
- **Ranged Weapon Damage Bonus:** +0/+0/+3
- **Distance Bonus:** +10
- **Disengage:** +1
- You also gain the use of the Protective Attack and Patient Shot signature abilities.

Kit signature abilities already have their bonuses applied. For example, you might take the Martial Artist kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +2/+2/+2, and the Mountain kit, which gives a melee weapon damage bonus of +0/+0/+3. If you choose to use the Mountain kit’s damage bonus, then the Battle Grace signature ability from the Martial Artist kit would reduce its damage by -2/-2/-2, as it loses the bonus from the Martial Artist kit. It then gains the +0/+0/+3 of the Mountain kit, to deal damage of 2/5/10 for its tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 results.

### MARK

You know how to focus the attention of your allies as you push them toward victory. You have the following ability:

#### MARK

You draw your allies’ attention to a specific foe—with devastating effect.  
**Keywords:** Ranged  
**Type:** Maneuver  
**Distance:** Ranged 10  
**Target:** 1 creature  
**Effect:** The target is marked by you until the start of your next turn. When attacking a marked target, you and each of your allies gain a damage surge �.  
**Spend 1 Focus or More Focus:** You focus on understanding the tactics of your foe, countering their strengths and exploiting their weaknesses to enhance your squad.

Each focus is banked on the marked creature, increasing the effectiveness of your mark, as indicated on your doctrine’s focused mark table below. A marked creature with focus on it stays marked until the end of the encounter. When the marked creature is reduced to 0 Stamina or otherwise removes the mark, you regain the focus.

You can use this maneuver on an already marked creature to bank more focus.

# TALENT

The talent is a master of psionics, a source of incredible power created through sheer force of will. A talent can move and change matter, time, gravity, the laws of physics, or another creature’s mind. In rare occurrences, people are born with the potential to harness psionic power, but only those who experience an awakening, an event that activates a talent’s abilities, can actually tap into the mind’s strength.

The talent is limited only by the strength of their mind. Powerful psionic heroes can have multiple active powers at once and change reality at will. But with this limitless potential comes a gamble. Every manifestation has a chance of harming the talent, and those who use too many too quickly die from the exertion.

## BASICS

**Starting Characteristics:** You start with a Reason of 2 and a Presence of 2, and can choose one of the following arrays for your other characteristics scores:
- 2, −1, −1
- 1, 1, −1
- 1, 0, 0

**Weak Potency:** Reason score − 1  
**Average Potency:** Reason score  
**Strong Potency:** Reason score + 1  
**Starting Stamina at 1st Level:** 18  
**Stamina Gained at 2nd and greater levels:** 9  
**Recoveries:** 8  

**Skills:** You have Psionics and Read Person. Choose any two skills from the interpersonal or lore skill groups.

## TALENT ADVANCEMENT

| Level | Features | Abilities | Tradition Abilities |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| 1st   | Tradition, Clarity and Strain, Mind Spike, Telepathic Speech, Tradition Features, Mind Focus, Talent Ward, Talent Abilities | Two signatures, 3, 5 | - |
| 2nd   | Perk, Tradition Feature, Tradition Ability | Two signatures, 3, 5 | - |
| 3rd   | Scan, 7-Clarity Ability | Two signatures, 3, 5, 7 | - |

## 1ST-LEVEL FEATURES

As a talent, you gain the following features:

### TRADITION

Psionic abilities manifest into one of multiple categories. Some examples of categories include:
- **Animapathy:** Abilities that allow you to manipulate, meld, and exchange the souls of living things.
- **Chronopathy:** Abilities that allow you to view future and past events, and to manipulate time to aid allies and hinder foes.
- **Cryokinesis:** Abilities that allow you to manifest and manipulate absolute cold to freeze the water and air within and around the environment.
- **Metamorphosis:** Abilities that allow you to strengthen and manipulate your body and the bodies of others, allowing for the performance of preternatural exploits.
- **Pyrokinesis:** Abilities that allow you to create and manipulate fire by interacting with the potential energy found in all things.
- **Resopathy:** Abilities that allow you to manipulate matter and space to create, alter, or displace your environment and the creatures and objects in it.
- **Telekinesis:** Abilities that allow you to physically manipulate creatures and objects.
- **Telepathy:** Abilities that allow you to communicate with, read, and influence the minds of other creatures.

As talents gain mastery over their minds, they find a tradition for one psionic category that’s as easy to manifest as it is to breathe. Choose one of the following categories to be your tradition: chronopathy, telekinesis, or telepathy. Other talent affinities will be featured in future products. Your choice determines your Tradition Triggered Action and Tradition Features in addition to several features you get at later levels.

### CLARITY AND STRAIN

Your mind is your greatest asset, and the clarity of your thoughts is what empowers your psionic abilities. You have a heroic resource called clarity.

#### CLARITY IN COMBAT

When a combat encounter (or other stressful situation tracked in rounds as determined by the Director) begins, you gain clarity equal to your Victories. At the start of each of your turns in combat, you gain 1d3 clarity.

You can choose to spend clarity you do not have, going into negative numbers. Your negative clarity limit is equal to 1 + your Reason. At the end of your turn, you take 1d6 damage for each clarity you have below 0.

While you have clarity below 0, you are strained. Some psionic abilities have additional effects if you are already strained or become strained when you use them. Strained effects can still impact you even after you are no longer strained.

Your clarity disappears at the end of the encounter.

## CLARITY OUTSIDE OF COMBAT

Though you can’t gain clarity outside of combat, you can use your heroic abilities and effects that cost clarity without spending it. If you use two or more heroic abilities or effects that cost clarity within 1 minute of each other, you take 1d6 damage and incur any strain effects from using them.

Whenever you use an ability or effect that costs clarity outside of combat, you can’t use that same ability or effect again outside of combat until you gain at least 1 Victory or finish a Respite.

If you use an ability that lets you spend unlimited clarity on its effect out of combat, you can use it as if you had spent an amount of clarity on it equal to your Victories.

### MIND SPIKE

You can fire a bolt of psychic energy into an enemy’s mind. You gain access to the Mind Spike ability, which can be used as a ranged free strike:

- 12-16: 4 psychic damage  
- 17+: 6 psychic damage  

**Strained:** The attack deals an extra 2 psychic damage to the target and yourself. This damage ignores your immunities.

### TELEPATHIC SPEECH

You know the Mindspeech language. You can also telepathically communicate with creatures within the distance of your Mind Spike ability if they share a language with you and you know of each other. The receiver of your telepathic communications can choose to respond telepathically.

## TRADITION FEATURES

You can choose to deliver it to the target personally, via a courier, or leave it in a covert location for the target to find. You can only have one notice active at a time.

It is up to the Director when the target receives the notice. Once the target receives your notice, they become alarmed and take desperate measures to stop you.

The Director may choose to award the heroes with 1 Hero Token to stop you from forming this bond and make you infamous with the community instead.

# KITS

The knight in shining armor. The warrior priest. The sniper. Censors, furies, shadows, tacticians, and troubadours can tap into these and many more archetypal concepts using kits. A kit is a combination of weapons, armor, and fighting techniques that lets you personalize martial heroes for battle.

## CHANGING YOUR KIT

Your choice of kit is always flexible, and your hero is never locked into a specific kit. If you want to change your kit, you can do so as a respite activity (see Respite).

## KIT EQUIPMENT

Each kit includes an armor entry and a weapons entry. It’s important to know what equipment a kit uses, because that informs your hero’s appearance and story. It also determines the type of magic and psionic treasures they can wield.

The description of gear in your kit is limited to broad categories, leaving you free to decide the specifics that best align with your vision of the character. For instance, the Guisarmier kit provides medium armor and a polearm. One player using this kit could wear heavy layers of hide and wield a longspear, while another might wear a shining breastplate and carry a halberd into battle.

The equipment categories your kit gives you are part of what affects the math behind your kit’s benefits, alongside the fighting techniques each kit provides.

You can wear armor and wield weapons that aren’t part of your kit, but if you don’t, you don’t get your kit’s bonuses.

## CUSTOMIZING EQUIPMENT APPEARANCES

You should absolutely feel free to describe your equipment in a way that makes sense for the story of your game and hero. For instance, if your hero uses a weapon in the whip category as part of their kit, they could use a leather whip, a spiked chain, or a dagger tied to a knotted rope. A hero who wears heavy armor might wear a suit of chain mail, plate armor, or heavy wooden planks tied together. Your choices for equipment aren’t limited just to the examples in this book.

## KIT ARMOR CATEGORIES

Each kit has an armor category that indicates the kind of protection you have while using the kit.

### NONE

If a kit has no armor, you can wear whatever clothing you like! Robes, a fashionable tunic and pants, or just a loincloth—it’s totally up to you.

### LIGHT ARMOR

If a kit features light armor, you might wear padded cloth, leather armor, or even a chain shirt.

### MEDIUM ARMOR

If a kit has medium armor, you might wear layers of thick hides, a breastplate, or armor made of metal scales.

### HEAVY ARMOR

If a kit has heavy armor, then you’re likely wearing metal from head to toe. Chain mail, ring mail, and suits of plate armor protect you better than any other mundane protection.

### SHIELD

If a kit has a shield, then you wield a shield that can be any shape and made of any mundane material you like. The best shields have a sweet insignia on them, so start thinking about yours!

## KIT WEAPON CATEGORIES

Each kit has a weapon category that indicates the types of weapons you wield while using the kit. You can use any ability with the Weapon keyword even if your kit doesn’t have a weapon, but you don’t get to apply your kit’s bonuses to that ability.

### BOW

Bows cover any weapon used to fire an arrow or bolt projectile. This includes crossbows, longbows, and shortbows. You don’t need to track mundane ammunition for these weapons, unless the Director says otherwise.

### ENSNARING WEAPON

Ensnaring weapons include bolas, nets, and other weapons made to capture an enemy and hold them in place.

### HEAVY WEAPON

Heavy weapons are two-handed melee weapons with weighty bladed or bludgeoning heads, made to seriously harm or kill enemies in a single mighty blow. Greatswords, greataxes, mauls, and morningstars are all examples of heavy weapons.

### LIGHT WEAPON

Light weapons are one-handed melee weapons that can be used to make several strikes in rapid succession. Many such weapons can be thrown or used as an off-hand defensive weapon. Daggers, shortswords, rapiers, and throwing hammers are typical light weapons.

If your kit uses a light weapon, you can wield two light weapons at a time.

### MEDIUM WEAPON

Medium weapons are one-handed melee weapons that can be carried into battle while leaving one hand free, or while using that hand to hold a shield or implement. Battleaxes, clubs, longswords, and warhammers are medium weapons.

### POLEARM

Polearms are two-handed melee weapons with long hafts that increase the wielder’s reach. They include glaives, halberds, longspears, and quarterstaffs.

### UNARMED STRIKE

Any kit that uses unarmed strikes allows you to use your body as a weapon. Punches, kicks, eye gouges, and the like are your forte.

# WHIP

Whip weapons include the standard whip, but also include spiked chains, flails, and any similarly long and flexible melee weapon.

## IMPROVISED WEAPONS

Improvised weapons include rocks, bottles, plates, furniture, and anything else you pick up that can be bashed, hurled, or stabbed into an enemy. As well, any weapons that aren’t part of your kit count as improvised weapons for you. If you’re not using a kit with unarmed strikes, then your feet and fists are improvised weapons. If you’re not using a kit and pick up a sword to use as part of a melee free strike, the sword counts as an improvised weapon.

Improvised weapons can be used to make attacks with the Weapon keyword that you gain from your class, though not from your kit. They add no special bonuses from your kit to the attack. Many melee-focused heroes choose a kit that maximizes their melee capabilities, then make ranged free strikes with improvised weapons.

## KITS AND TREASURES

When you find a supernatural item such as a magic sword, you can use the item as long as it matches one of your kit’s equipment categories. A Blade of Quintessence is a medium weapon, so you can use it with the Ranger or Shining Armor kits. However, you can’t use it with the Cloak and Dagger or Spellslinger kits because those kits don’t use medium weapons, meaning you haven’t done the necessary preparations to use the weapon effectively. You can still swing a Blade of Quintessence around, but you don’t get any of its bonuses or benefits.

If you find a piece of equipment you really want to use that isn’t part of your kit, you can always change your kit as a respite activity.

## KIT BONUSES AND TRAITS

A kit can increase your Stamina, speed, and stability, as well as the damage, distance, and reach of your weapon abilities. Kit bonuses are applied to free strikes.

### STAMINA BONUS

Your kit’s Stamina bonus is added to your Stamina maximum.

### SPEED BONUS

Your kit’s speed bonus is added to your speed.

### STABILITY BONUS

Your kit’s stability bonus is added to your stability.

### DAMAGE BONUSES

Martial and caster kits can grant you a bonus to damage with certain types of abilities.

#### MELEE DAMAGE BONUS

Kits can have a melee damage bonus. This bonus is added to abilities with both the Melee and Weapon keywords that deal damage.

#### RANGED DAMAGE BONUS

Kits can have a ranged damage bonus. This bonus is added to abilities with both the Ranged and Weapon keywords that deal damage.

### BONUSES ACROSS TIERS

Kit damage bonuses are presented as “+X/+Y/+Z.” The X bonus is added to qualifying tier 1 power roll results, the Y bonus is added to qualifying tier 2 power roll results, and the Z bonus is added to qualifying tier 3 power roll results. For example, the Shining Armor Kit has a +2/+2/+2 melee damage bonus, increasing the damage of your abilities with the Melee and Weapon keywords across all tier results. The Sniper kit has a +0/+0/+3 ranged damage bonus, having no effect on tier 1 and 2 results, increasing the damage of tier 3 results by 3 for your ranged weapon abilities.

### DISTANCE BONUS

Your kit’s ranged distance bonus increases the distance of your abilities with the Ranged and Weapon keywords. Your kit’s melee distance bonus increases the distance of your abilities with the Melee and Weapon keywords. A distance bonus doesn’t increase the size of any ability’s area of effect.

### DISENGAGE BONUS

Your kit’s disengage bonus increases the number of squares you can shift when you take the Disengage move action. You can shift an additional number of squares equal to the bonus when you use Disengage.

## KIT SIGNATURE ABILITY

Each kit grants you a signature ability, which already includes the kit’s bonuses.

For details on the ability format, see Abilities.

# OPTIONAL RULE: LOSING EQUIPMENT

The rules of the game expect that heroes always have access to their equipment. That’s because for most of the time in the game, heroes aren’t worried about surviving for days on end in a dungeon and tracking every piece of gear they carry. However, there could be times where your group wants to tell a story of heroes who are captured and stripped of their equipment, or who find themselves at a masquerade where weapons need to be checked at the door. For those sorts of scenarios, you can use the following rules:

- If your kit has armor and you aren’t wearing or wielding it, then you lose your kit’s bonuses to Stamina and stability. If you lose your shield but keep the rest of your armor, your Stamina decreases by 3.
