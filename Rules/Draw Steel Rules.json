  "WHAT IS THIS GAME?": {
    "TACTICAL": "Strategy is: “What are we trying to do?” Break a siege, free a prisoner, rescue a captive, steal a tome of ancient lore. Strategy is about long-term goals.\n\nTactics is about: “How are we going to do that?” We’re going to … surround them! Sneak around them! Pick them off one by one! Kill their leader first. Kill their priest first! “No resurrections!”\n\nIn a tactical game, positioning matters. So our game is played on a grid. Effects and distances are measured in squares. This means everyone is looking at the same problem, and there is no ambiguity regarding where the heroes and villains are in relation to each other. The hobgoblin troopers are setting themselves up in a line to stop our tactician and fury from getting into melee with the hobgoblin war mage. We can all see that happening, and can talk about what we’re going to do to stop it.\n\nThat means teamwork matters. That’s why initiative works the way it does—to encourage the players to plan! “Okay, you use Concussive Slam on that trooper, it’ll push him back, and on my turn I can use Phalanx Forward to get us all into melee with the death captain.”\n\nWe think focusing on teamwork also makes the game more heroic! :D\n\nIn a tactical game, you have many choices each round. You are never reduced to just swinging your sword. You have options. If we do a good job, you don’t feel like you outlasted your opponents because you wore their hit points down before they could reduce yours to 0—you feel like you beat those hobgoblins! Through stealth and sorcery, coordination and ferocity!\n\nAs you play with the same group of characters, you learn what they can all do. You discover synergies, “combos.” Some of them intended by the designers, some not! You start to learn these unique characters, and rely on them to do their cool things. It’s a great feeling when another player comes up with a cool plan that relies on your unique abilities.\n\nYou learn which characters are the “squishies” who need to be protected or healed. You learn which characters can push themselves right to the edge and keep fighting. “Don’t worry about healing Barlaca. She’s our fury. She’s happier with 3 Stamina.”\n\nOur game is not about tactics. It’s not a war game. But it is tactical.",
    "HEROIC": "Our game is definitely about heroism! :D\n\nFor us, this means a couple of things. It means we don’t assume your character is primarily motivated by greed. They might be! But we don’t assume that. Instead we assume you’re going to do the right thing. It might take some convincing, and there might be some reluctant heroes in your party, but that’s part of the fun!\n\nYou should absolutely be able to run a *Chain of Acheron*-style campaign where the heroes are hard-bitten mercenaries in a morally ambiguous world. But that’s not the baseline assumption. The fiction and adventures that inspire us feature epic villains trying to remake the world in their image, and the dashing, unyielding heroes who strive against them even in the face of impossible odds.\n\nSo that’s one component of the heroic keyword. But another component, equally important, is what kinds of things happen “on-screen,” so to speak. This is very closely related to the cinematic keyword.\n\nFor instance, you never see Indiana Jones having to find a local sporting goods store because he needs to stock up on ammo. You never see Katniss Everdeen have to stop and take a shower because she stinks.\n\nThese things do happen. No one watching *Raiders of the Lost Ark* thinks that Indy’s gun is magical and doesn’t need bullets—but we just don’t need to see Indy doing that stuff. We don’t need to waste time on it.",
    "CINEMATIC": "Closely tied to the heroic keyword, the cinematic keyword is about how we like powers and abilities with a strong visual component. You can imagine your character doing or saying these things. “In All This Confusion” is a good name for the shadow’s ability to slip out of melee and retreat to safety. The text of the ability says how it works, but the name creates a visual that explains how it’s working.\n\nWhen Sir Vanazor the dragon knight fury leaps onto a goblin war spider, cleaving through the goblins riding the creature in a single turn, you can see it in your mind. It feels like a movie. It doesn’t feel simply as if you rolled well, but like an epic scene, complete with slow motion and a Carpenter Brut soundtrack.\n\nYou should imagine your tactician character leading the battle, granting your allies free attacks, extra maneuvers. Coordinating the battle. That’s what the name implies. And if we’ve done a good job, when you read the character’s abilities, you think, “Yes! This is what I was imagining! I can’t wait to do this!”",
    "FANTASY": "Just … you know … it’s got dragons and stuff. :D\n\nIt’s worth mentioning—while everyone basically already knows what fantasy means in this context, we do imagine it a little more broadly than your average classical medieval fantasy. We like that stuff! Vasloria is our medieval European fantasy analog with knights on horseback and wizards in towers. But we also like high fantasy urban intrigue, and so we’re developing Capital, the City of the Great Game, the Greatest City In This or Any Age. Vasloria is mostly humans and elves and orcs and dwarves, but Capital has dozens, hundreds of different ancestries in it.\n\nLooking back at movies like Star Wars and the work of artists like Chris Foss, that ’70s stuff now seems explicitly fantastical. There’s nothing scientific or even plausible about a lightsaber or a John Berkey spaceship. But damn, they look cool!\n\nSo our setting includes the timescape—our multiverse, of which the world of Orden containing Capital and Vasloria is only one part. The timescape is more explicitly “space fantasy.”\n\nThese core rules mostly cover the classic fantasy stuff. But we think Capital and the timescape will help us deliver a game where more people can see their fantasy in our worlds.\n\nFor us, fantasy includes magic, like wizards casting spells, and psionics, the natural and focused ability some creatures have to manipulate and warp reality with their minds. You know, telekinesis and telepathy! Jean Grey style! Although heroes have a few of these options in the core rules, you’ll see more psionics in later products.",
    "IF YOU’RE COMING FROM D20 FANTASY…": "If you’ve most often played medieval fantasy RPGs that use a d20 and have Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma as primary creature statistics, you’re going to notice a lot of similarities between that style of game and Draw Steel. But as talked about above, our game is explicitly heroic and tactical, and it includes our own ideas of what a fantasy world should include. As such, you’ll definitely notice some differences. We might use similar terminology for rules, but our use of those game terms might mean different things, because we’re trying to support a specific style of play and there are only so many words that make sense to use with a fantasy game in the English language.\n\nHere are a few key distinctions between this game and typical d20 fantasy that you’ll notice right away. These aren’t the only distinctions, but they’re the most obvious:\n\n['**Attacks automatically deal damage.** You can still have a bad turn! A tier one result is not awesome, but at least you’re making progress. The trick is: who’s making progress faster? You or the monsters? Since there’s no “I miss, next” in this game, fights tend to be short. 5 rounds is a long fight. Because everyone’s always doing damage!', '**You don’t need to rest all the time.** Most d20 fantasy games are games of attrition. Your spell slots and other features dwindle as the adventuring day goes on. In Draw Steel, you need to rest to regain your Stamina and Recoveries (the stat that determine how robust you are in combat). But all characters earn the ability to use their magic and other awesome abilities as they adventure, encouraging you to press on heroically.', '**Character options are different.** We very strongly recommend you start by looking through the character creation section before you decide what you want to play. You can’t just assume the conduit is “basically a cleric.” In some ways it is! But in other ways it’s very different. You may have some cool character archetype you love to play in d20 Fantasy and you’re dying to see how it works in *Draw Steel*, but you’ll have a lot more fun if you start by browsing the Ancestries and Class sections and being inspired. Once you know how the game works, you’ll have a better handle on how to build your favorite character in here.', '**Smaller bonuses and penalties** *Draw Steel* is built around the roll of two ten-sided dice to produce three possible outcomes. On the surface, this might not seem that different from rolling a twenty-sided die and having two outcomes, but we’ve run the math. A lot. A bonus of +1 or penalty of −2 is significant in *Draw Steel*, much more so than in a typical d20 fantasy game. That means you should feel pretty good attempting most power rolls—the rolls you make to determine success out of combat—if you have a decent characteristic bonus on those rolls. And if you have a specific skill that applies to a power roll made as a test outside of combat, you’ll do even better.', '**Our game has a lot of skills** Your character can make use of a long list of skills, but we don’t expect you to memorize that list. We get into why there are so many skills in the *Tests* chapter, but the short version is that we think having a lot of skills allows you to create more distinct and specialized heroes, which supports the sort of gameplay we want to see in *Draw Steel*. And skills in *Draw Steel* aren’t tied to characteristics. If you’re trying to lose someone in a crowd? You can use Presence to Hide! Why not?', '**We won’t be able to point out every difference.** Beyond what’s noted here, don’t assume that these rules work like any d20 fantasy game you’ve played. We don’t have the space to point out every exception. So if you’re in doubt about how something works, put d20 fantasy out of your mind and read our rules without those assumptions, and you’ll find that things make better sense. If you’re still confused, stop by the MCDM Discord and ask. We’ve got tons of awesome community members ready to help!', '**We don’t expect you to do everything to the letter.** This is actually one thing *Draw Steel* does have in common with d20 fantasy. This is a big book of rules! Don’t stress if you need to look something up or make a ruling about an edge case on the fly. If everyone’s having fun, you’re doing it right.']"

  "THE BASICS": {
    "CHARACTERISTICS": {
      "MIGHT": "Might (MGT) represents strength and brawn. A creature’s ability to break down doors, swing an axe, stand up during an earthquake, or hurl an ally across a chasm is determined by Might.",
      "AGILITY": "Agility (AGL) represents coordination and nimbleness. A creature’s ability to backflip out of danger, shoot a crossbow, dodge an explosion, or pluck keys from a guard’s belt is determined by Agility.",
      "REASON": "Reason (REA) represents a logical mind and education. A creature’s ability to solve a puzzle that unlocks a door, recall lore about necromancy, decipher a coded message, or blast a foe with psionic power is determined by Reason.",
      "INTUITION": "Intuition (INU) represents instincts and experience. A creature’s ability to hear the approach of a distant rider, figure out the tell of a bluffing gambler, calm a rearing horse, or track a monster across the tundra is determined by Intuition.",
      "PRESENCE": "Presence (PRS) represents force of personality. A creature’s ability to lie to a judge, convince a crowd to join a revolution, impress a queen at a royal banquet, or cast a magic spell by singing a song is determined by Presence.",
      "CHARACTERISTIC SCORES": "Each characteristic has a score that runs from −5 to +5. The higher a score, the more impact the creature has with that characteristic. A baby bunny rabbit would have a Might score of −5, while an ancient dragon would have a Might score of 5. The average human has a score of 0 in all their characteristics. Characteristic scores are added to power rolls—the dice rolls you make whenever your character attempts a task with an uncertain outcome (see Power Rolls)."
    },
    "DICE": {
      "D3S": "On rare occasions, the rules ask a player to roll one or more three-sided dice (also called d3s). If you don’t have a d3, you can roll a six-sided die instead, treating a roll of 1–2 as a 1, a roll of 3–4 as a 2, and a roll of 5–6 as a 3."
    },
    "POWER ROLLS": {
      "TYPES OF POWER ROLLS": "The game uses three types of power rolls:\n\n['**Ability Roll**: Used when you activate certain abilities to determine their impact.', '**Resistance Roll**: Made to avoid harmful effects.', '**Test**: Made outside of using your abilities to affect or interact with the world around you.']",
      "MAKING A POWER ROLL": {
        "POWER ROLL OUTCOMES": "The result of a power roll determines your outcome tier—three levels that determine how successful your power roll is.\n\n**Tier 1**: If your power roll result is 11 or lower, it is a tier 1 result. This is the worst result a power roll can have. If you’re using an ability, a tier 1 result means you still do something, but the impact of what you do is minimal. With this result, an attack ability might deal a little bit of damage and not do much else. For a test, a tier 1 result means you fail at what you set out to do, and you might also suffer a negative consequence. \n\n**Tier 2**: If your power roll result is 12 to 16, it is a tier 2 result. This is the average result of many power rolls, especially for heroes who are 1st level. When using an ability, a tier 2 result means that what you do has a moderate impact. With this result, an attack ability deals a decent amount of damage and has an effect that briefly helps allies or hinders enemies. For a test, a tier 2 result means you might succeed at what you set out to do— though depending on the difficulty, success might have a cost. \n\n**Tier 3**: If your power roll result is 17 or higher, it is a tier 3 result. This is the best result a power roll can have. When using an ability, a tier 3 result means you deliver the maximum impact possible. With this result, an attack ability deals a lot of damage and has a powerful or lasting effect on enemies or allies. For a test, a tier 3 result means you succeed at what you set out to do. If the test has an easy difficulty, you also get a little something extra in addition to your success",
        "DOWNGRADE A POWER ROLL": "Whenever you make a power roll, you can downgrade it to select the result of a lower tier. For instance, if an ability has a tier 3 result that lets you impose the restrained condition on a creature, but the tier 2 result for that ability lets you impose the slowed condition, you can use the tier 2 result if you would rather have the creature slowed than restrained.\n\nIf you downgrade a critical hit, you still get the extra action benefit of the critical hit (see Critical Hit in Abilities).",
        "NATURAL RESULT": "The result of your power roll before your characteristic or any other modifiers are applied is called the natural result. The rules often refer to this as “rolling a natural X,” where X is the result of the roll. For example, if you get a 20 on the power roll before adding your characteristic, this is called rolling a natural 20.\n\nWhenever you roll a natural 19 or 20 on a power roll, you always achieve the tier 3 result, no matter what characteristic is added to the roll."
      },
      "EDGES AND BANES": {
        "EDGE": "An edge represents a situational advantage a hero or an enemy has when making a power roll. For example, a standing hero who makes a melee attack against a prone creature gains an edge on the power roll for their attack. A pair of magic gloves that makes your hands sticky might grant you an edge when making a power roll to climb walls!\n\nWhen you make a power roll with a single edge, you add 2 to the roll. If you make a power roll with two or more edges, you have a double edge. This means you don’t add anything to the power roll, but the result of the roll automatically improves one tier (to a maximum of tier 3).",
        "BANE": "A bane represents a situational disadvantage a hero or an enemy has when making a power roll. For example, if you make an attack while prone, the power roll for the attack takes a bane. A rainstorm might give you a bane on a power roll made to climb an outdoor wall because the weather makes the stone surface extra slick.\n\nWhen you make a power roll with a single bane, you subtract 2 from the roll. If you make a power roll with two or more banes, you have a double bane. This means you don’t subtract anything from the power roll, but the result of the roll automatically decreases one tier (to a minimum of tier 1).",
        "ROLLING WITH EDGES AND BANES": "Under certain circumstances, you might have one or more edges and banes on the same roll. For instance, you might take a bane when weakened by poison, even as you gain an edge for attacking a prone creature. In general, edges and banes cancel each other out, resolving as follows:\n\n['If you have an edge and a bane, or if you have a double edge and a double bane, the roll is made as usual without any edges or banes.', 'If you have a double edge and just one bane, the roll is made with one edge, regardless of how many single edge instances contribute to the double edge.', 'If you have a double bane and just one edge, the roll is made with one bane, regardless of how many single bane instances contribute to the double bane.']",
        "WHEN TO USE EDGES AND BANES": "The rules tell you when to modify a roll with an edge or a bane. The Director can also modify rolls with edges and banes as a response to narrative or environmental circumstances. For instance, no rule specifically says that rain imposes a bane on power rolls made to climb a stone wall. But it makes sense that rainy conditions should make climbing that wall harder, so a Director should absolutely do so!",
        "WHY CAP?": "['We capped edges and banes at a maximum of two each for several reasons, including thinking about the narrative of those penalties. Every little advantage or disadvantage in a heroic story has diminishing returns, acknowledging that a creature can only benefit or be hindered by short-term circumstances so much. For example, a character who is prone and weakened by poison already finds it difficult to attack—so that becoming restrained by a net can’t really make it harder.', 'We also liked capping edges and banes at two because it keeps play quick. It’s nice to not need to count beyond two positive or negative circumstances in a battle with a lot of effects flying around.']"
      },
      "BONUSES AND PENALTIES": "While edges and banes cover most circumstantial effects that can have an impact on a power roll, a few rules add numeric bonuses or penalties to power rolls. Bonus and penalty values are specified in the rules that impose them, and are calculated independently of edges and banes, and before edges and banes are factored into a power roll. There is no limit to the number of bonuses or penalties that can apply to a power roll, and bonuses and penalties always add together.\n\nThough it might sound as if the math with bonuses and penalties can get confusing, fear not! Bonuses and penalties are rare except in the case of skills, which appear on your character sheet (see Skills for more information)."
    },
    "HERO TOKENS": {
      "FOR THE DIRECTOR: AWARDING HERO TOKENS": "['You can award hero tokens to the players for taking risks with their heroes beyond what the game typically expects of them. For instance, battling a group of monsters is part of the game and doesn’t earn a hero token. However, the following sorts of activities might:', ['A hero stands alone against a group of enemies to allow their comrades to escape.', 'A hero willingly jumps into quicksand, into lava, off a cliff, or into some other hazard to save another character.', 'The group is presented with an easy way out of a difficult situation that involves lying, cheating, stealing, or the like, but they take the more arduous and honorable path.', 'A hero gives away an important resource, such as a Healing Potion, to help another creature in need.']]"
    },
    "GAME OF EXCEPTIONS": "This game has a fair number of rules. But it also has plenty of character options, specialized equipment, and other game elements that let you break those rules. This is on purpose! Breaking the rules allows heroes to feel special and makes their foes seem extra dangerous.\n\nIf you’re not sure what to do when two rules come into conflict with each other, remember that a specific exception always beats a more general rule. The Director has the final say in how rules are adjudicated.",
    "ALWAYS ROUND DOWN": "There are times when the rules tell you to divide a number in half. Whenever you divide an odd number in half and it results in a decimal, round the result down to the nearest whole number. For instance, if you have a speed of 7 and become slowed (a condition that halves your speed), then your speed becomes 3.",
    "CREATURES AND OBJECTS": "This game uses the terms “creature” and “object.” Creatures are living or unliving beings such as animals, elves, humans, dragons, giants, zombies, and valok. Objects are inanimate matter such as walls, carriages, cups, swords, ropes, coins, paintings, columns, and buildings. Creatures always have stat blocks that relay their statistics, but objects do not.\n\nWhen a creature dies, their body becomes an object, and can be affected by abilities and other effects that target objects. For example, a talent can’t use their Telekinesis power to slide an unwilling enemy cult leader into an evil temple’s pit of hellfire. But if that boss dies, the talent can slide their body into the pit to prevent the boss from being raised as a powerful undead by the temple’s magic.\n\nThe game sometimes refers to “unattended objects,” which are objects that aren’t held, worn, or controlled by a creature. Whenever an ability affects objects, it affects only unattended objects unless the Director determines otherwise.",
    "PCS AND NPCS": "Two types of characters inhabit the world of the game— the player characters (also called PCs or heroes) who are created and controlled by the players, and nonplayer characters (NPCs) created and controlled by the Director. NPCs can include any of the game’s monsters, but when the rules refer to NPCs, they generally do so in the context of interacting with them outside of combat.",
    "BUILDING A HEROIC NARRATIVE": {
      "VICTORIES": {
        "VICTORIES AFTER COMBAT": "Each time your hero survives a combat encounter in which the party’s objectives are achieved, your Victories increase by 1. The Director can decide that a trivially easy encounter doesn’t increase a hero’s Victories.",
        "VICTORIES AFTER NONCOMBAT CHALLENGES": "When your hero successfully overcomes a big challenge that doesn’t involve combat, the Director can award you 1 Victory. Such challenges can include things like a particularly complicated and deadly trap, a negotiation, a montage test, a complicated puzzle, or the execution of a clever idea that avoids a battle.",
        "VICTORIES RESET": "Whenever you finish a respite (see Respite), your Victories are converted into Experience."
      },
      "FOR THE DIRECTOR: AWARDING VICTORIES": "['We’re still figuring out rules for encounter building, but here are some general guidelines.', 'A successful combat in which the party’s objectives are achieved earns the heroes 1 Victory. Particularly hard encounters are worth 2 Victories when completed. We’ll have better guidelines on this topic in the future, but for now, consider tough boss battles worth 2 Victories.', 'A successful negotiation or montage test should earn the heroes 1 Victory. Other noncombat challenges are left to the Director’s discretion, but consider the following guidelines to help you determine when awarding 1 Victory is warranted:', ['If the heroes overcome a complicated trap that requires more than one test to find and disarm, award them 1 Victory.', 'If the heroes investigate a series of clues in a mystery, award 1 Victory when they solve the mystery.', 'If the heroes solve a complicated puzzle that requires them to use resources or would take most people at least 10 minutes to complete, award them a Victory.', 'If the heroes achieve a major story goal that accomplishes a quest (such as saving a prince trapped by an evil baroness or stopping a necromancer from performing a world-ending ritual), award them 1 Victory.', 'If the heroes use clever thinking to easily and surprisingly overcome or bypass a combat encounter, a negotiation, a montage test, a trap, a puzzle, or some other challenge that would award them 1 or more Victories in a more difficult fashion, award them 1 Victory. Clever thinking is just as worthy of a Victory—if not more so!'], 'At the Director’s discretion, particularly hard negotiations, puzzles, mysteries, and other noncombat challenges can be worth 2 Victories.']",
      "EXPERIENCE": "Victories temporarily increase a hero’s power during an adventure, but Experience (or XP) permanently improves their capabilities. Each time you finish a respite (see below), you gain XP equal to your Victories, then your Victories drop to 0. In other words, your Victories are converted to XP when you finish a respite.\n\nFor more information on how XP increases your hero’s power, see Heroic Advancement.",
      "HEROIC RESOURCES": "Your hero has a Heroic Resource (sometimes two Heroic Resources) determined by your class, and which you manage during play. For many classes, earning Resources can increase your hero’s power, and Resources are spent to activate your most powerful abilities. Other classes, like the talent, earn a negative resource that gives them a penalty during battle, and they gain the resource to activate their most powerful abilities. Each class gains and uses its Heroic Resource differently, and resources aren’t equivalent across classes. For example, 1 piety for the conduit isn’t worth as much as 1 focus for the tactician.\n\nSome classes, such as the tactician and the fury, generate and use Heroic Resources only during combat encounters. Others, such as the shadow and the talent, can use their Heroic Resources both in and out of combat.\n\nYour hero’s class description has more information about how to use your Heroic Resource.",
      "BAGS OF RATS AIN’T HEROIC": "['Some players might think that quickly starting a fight with some bar patrons or carrying around a bag of rats is a good way to gather up those sweet, sweet Victories and Heroic Resources. Those strategies don’t work! The rules of the game exist to help you tell a cool heroic fantasy story, not so you can try to be clever and exploit them by harming innocent rats to “win.” In order to generate Victories and Heroic Resources, you must face and overcome challenges worthy of a hero!']",
      "RECOVERIES": {
        "SPENDING RECOVERIES": "During combat encounters and similarly dangerous situations when time is tracked in rounds (see Combat), you can use the Catch Breath action to regain Stamina. See Catch Breath in Actions for more information. Some heroes have abilities that allow them or their allies to spend more Recoveries without using the Catch Breath action.\n\nOutside of combat and other dangerous situations, you can spend Recoveries freely.",
        "REGAINING RECOVERIES": "You regain all lost Recoveries when you finish a respite (see Respite)."
      },
      "RESPITE": "A respite is a focused period of rest and recuperation that allows heroes to regain Stamina and Recoveries. During a respite, you must spend 24 hours uninterrupted and doing nothing but sleeping, eating, dressing your wounds, and recuperating. You can also undertake one respite activity, such as making a project roll (see Research and Crafting in future packets for more information), or changing your kit (see Kits).\n\nWhen you finish a respite, you regain all your Recoveries and Stamina, and your Victories convert to Experience. It is best to take a respite in a safe place where you aren’t in a hostile environment or at risk of being attacked. If your respite is interrupted by enemies attacking, an earth tremor, swarms of biting insects, and similar serious distractions, the respite ends early and you don’t gain the benefits for finishing it.\n\nThe standard eightish hours of sleep one gets at night doesn’t count as a respite. The rules assume that all heroes take the time to sleep, eat, and take care of all the other functions necessary for life even if they aren’t engaged in a respite."
    },
    "ORDEN AND THE TIMESCAPE": {
      "VASLORIA": "A forested medieval and feudal land, Vasloria holds few cities—just towns and villages. Western Vasloria, including most of Aendrim and Corwell and parts of Graid, was until recently ruled by Good King Omund. His draconian knights, the Dragon Phalanx, protected the weak from the strong, dispensing justice throughout the land. But Omund died fifteen years ago—and so died the rule of law in Vasloria. Now, forests claim towns and roads once held safe under his rule. The woods are dangerous, their only law that of tooth and claw.\n\nWhen Omund was betrayed by Mandrake, a captain of the Dragon Phalanx, his castle fell to Ajax the Invincible—now called the Overlord and the Iron Saint. Ajax’s wizard Mortum unlocked the secret of the ancient flying cities of the sky elves to raise the Chrysopolis, Ajax’s city-fortress in the sky.\n\nAjax abolished all faiths and temples in Vasloria. He executed the dukes who served King Omund loyally, leaving only the three surviving baronies of Dalrath, Bedegar, and Tor to hold human civilization together. Once, the people of all the lands of Vasloria were loose allies. There was trade between humans, elves, dwarves, and orcs.\n\nNow there is only suspicion.\n\nThe high elves of the Fallen City, once the sky elf city of Irranys, pay tribute to Ajax with ancient artifacts they plunder from their ruined home. The wode elves of the Orchid Court, lacking any centralized government or cities, refuse to bow to the Iron Saint.\n\nThe dwarves of Kal Kalavar pay tribute in prisoners they abduct from among those foolish enough to travel the roads unescorted—prisoners who serve Ajax as forced labor or are fed into the Body Banks. Brooding under the mountains in their fabled Hanging City of Kal Kalavar, the stone dwarves do not like this deal with the Overlord, but they lack the power—or perhaps the will—to rebel.\n\nThe Hawklords of the High Aerie now act as Ajax’s royal guard. Mounted on their giant hawks, these human warriors project Ajax’s power, enforce his tyrannical order, and extend his influence into every corner of the wilderness. Their mastery of the air means that any revolt or rebellion is seen and crushed quickly.\n\nThe Dragon Phalanx is broken now, its knights scattered. Ajax has placed a high bounty on their heads. Some folk still see Omund’s knights as symbols of justice, heroes of a lost age before might made right. But in every town, every village, there are always desperate people willing to collect the bounty, summoning the Hawklords to pluck any dragon knight foolish enough to travel without a disguise away to the Chrysopolis.\n\nThe peoples of Dalrath, Bedegar, and Tor, isolated and outnumbered, desperately fight a losing battle against the encroaching wilderness. Law dies. Chaos thrives.",
      "CAPITAL": {
        "THE GREAT HOUSES": "The Great Houses, Capital’s ancient noble families, reluctantly share power with the upstart guilds who think that their vast wealth entitles them to rule. The members of the Great Houses are proud of their city, and believe anyone, from anywhere, should be able to come to Capital and earn a living, own property, and expect justice. They just don’t think anyone else should be able to rule. The guilds of the city, by contrast, are more egalitarian, more democratic, largely obsessed with accruing wealth—and caring little for the welfare of the city or its people.\n\nThe Great Game is espionage, and House Alvaro are the best players in the world. Led by Duke Prospero, House Alvaro sponsors the Imperial University, the greatest center of learning in the world. Nobles from across Orden, including from lands as far away as Vanigar, send their children to learn diplomacy and statecraft at the university. The greatest spies in the world are all graduates of the Actian School, one of the university’s many colleges, which once doubled as the intelligence agency of Capital’s late prince.\n\nHouse Vorona runs the city’s navy, the largest military organization of any kind in Orden. Their engineers perfected the secret of blackpowder and guard it jealously.\n\nThe Imperial Navy’s canons protect trade across Orden, placing Capital at the center of international affairs. Vorona’s Far Mariners, aka the marines, are the closest thing to a citywide law enforcement organization. Each Great House is expected to police its own district.\n\nDuke Marco Vorona sponsors the Imperial War College, also known as the Academy. A prestigious institution rivaling any college of the Imperial University, the Academy boasts graduates among all the noble families in Orden. This widespread allegiance creates a vast informal network in the city, referred to cynically as the Old Class Ring, that gives House Vorona access to intelligence that other factions can only dream of.\n\nHouse Navarr, the oldest of the Great Houses, enforces the law of the Church of Saint Ysabella the Pitiless, which theycall justice. The house is led by His Grace Orsino, Duke Navarr, archbishop of that most powerful church in the city. Under his rule, House Navarr consolidates a vast network of different churches and knights across the region under one elaborate system of patronage.\n\nArguably the most powerful Great House, House Valetta controls the city’s tax collectors, known as the Arbitros Fiat. Valetta is led by the Duchess Lenore, who opened theCodex Mortis while in mourning for her assassinated husband Maximo, speaking a ritual from that ancient necromantic artifact that should have returned her love to life. Instead, she brought about the Lilac Night, which transformed everyone in her district into undead—including herself. The Duchess Lenore is now an immortal vampire queen, a dead lady ruling over a dead city.",
        "THE POWER OF THE GUILDS": "After the Lilac Night, with the city no longer able to rely on House Valetta to deliver the taxes it collected, Lady Shirome bought Great House status for the Fulcrum—the city’s assayer’s guild she controls—along with the Broadsheet Guild and the Farrier’s Guild. The Fulcrum controls the Trade Integrity Board, which sets lending rates and leads trade negotiations between Capital and other governments in Orden. It was that guild that convinced the late prince to switch the city to paper money. As a result, Capital is the first and only city in Orden to have a robust monetary policy.\n\nThe Broadsheet Guild, formally known as the Font, publishes the thrice-daily news sheets that everyone in the city reads. Guildmaster Inān al-Adwiyya uses a vast network of young people called the Paperfeathers to deliver and sell the broadsheets throughout the city. Lady al-Adwiyya knows almost everything happening anywhere in Capital.\n\nThe Farrier’s Guild, popularly known as the Rasp, controls transport throughout the city. The guild is led by Lord Kashimir, a heliox from the planar gateway city of Alloy. It was he who introduced the flying tapestries that metaphorically shrank Capital, allowing the rich and powerful to cross the thirteen-mile-wide city in just a few minutes. He also created the Kites, couriers famous for being able to get a message to anywhere in Capital in only a few hours. His monopoly on importing flying tapestries from Alloy gives Lord Kashimir enormous power, and he is not shy about wanting more."

      "THE MYRIAD WORLDS OF THE TIMESCAPE": "Orden is only one world in the timescape! Each star in the night sky is another world, though this fact is not known to most people living on Orden. Higher worlds are more energetic, affording access to alien technologies. Great star freighters ply the space lanes, with knights wielding psionically powered hard-light blades dueling against star pirates with hard-light blasters.\n\nThe lower worlds lack the energy necessary for such extraordinary technology to function, and so rely on magic to break the rules.\n\nOn Axiom, the Plane of Uttermost Law, the memonek live on a world teeming with complex, inorganic life. UNISOL, the Universal Solar League, ensures and protects trade across the upper worlds, defending the star freighters from pirates such as the time raiders and the infamous Sunrunners on their legendary ship the K.R.A.D Fearless.\n\nMeanwhile, on Proteus, the Sea of Eternal Change, the formless proteans rebelled against the synlirii who once ruled the plane of uttermost chaos, exiling the voiceless talkers to the World Below. Now the masters of their world, the proteans take to the stars in their living change-ships, hurling their small fleet against what they perceive as the tyrannical might of UNISOL.\n\nOn Quintessence, the lowest of the upper worlds, proteans and memonek alike rub shoulders with devils, fire dwarves, and even humans in Quintessence’s capital city of Alloy, the City at the Center of the Timescape. The Free City of Alloy, also known as the City of Brass, is the gateway to the timescape. People traveling to or from the upper and lower worlds meet here to trade goods and information, free from the inflexible laws of UNISOL.\n\nTraveling downward from Quintessence, one arrives on Orden, the Plane of Gods and Sorcery, highest of the lower worlds where magic rules. The gods, forbidden from interfering directly in a world with such a low energy state, rely on saints to enact their will. The technology from the upper worlds does not function down here, unless powered by a strong psionic mind, or the miracle mineral prismacore.\n\nAlmost coterminous with Orden is its sister-plane, the World Below, and the Dark Under All. This plane of exiles is ruled by A Lie Cloaked In Star’s Silver—the Queen of Night, and the first of the Three Sisters Below. The World Below is a land of vast caves and sunless seas. There are no stars here, no sky, but only endless caves and warrens. Some of those are vast enough to hold entire cities, including Or-Mazaar, the City of the Black Star, from where the Queen of Night rules.\n\nThe power of the World Below wanes, even as the power of Equinox rises. Also known as Dusk, this smaller parasitic manifold is home to the exiled shadow elves and ruled by the Queen of Shadows, third of the Three Sisters Below. She plots to return her people to their homeland in Orden, and to escape the twisted shadow world.\n\nThe last plane of law, the Seven Cities of Hell, is among the lowest of the lower planes. A realm of devils proud of their civilization, the Seven Cities are each ruled by an archduke who schemes to ascend to the Throne of Hell. Living in a world of bureaucratic law, the devil denizens of Hell have little interest in the other planes. Life is so much more interesting down here. The seven dukes of Hell conspired together once, agreeing to create the Order of Desolation, also known as the illriggers. Doing so was meant to extend their power into the timescape, and to defend the Seven Cities from the demon hordes below.\n\nThe demons of the Abyssal Waste, the lowest plane, claw and scramble over each other, competing for souls in this heat-blasted desert under a baleful, giant orange sun. Mindless collections of organs, claws, and teeth, demons collect souls until they reach sentience, gaining identity and the blessing of memory. These demons will do anything to escape upward out of the wasteland, lest they lose their collected souls, lose their identities, and fall into that mindless state called lethe.\n\nAt the center of the Abyssal Waste lies the Necropolitan Ruin, the Last City. A great city of the dead, the site is ruled by Khorsekef, once the Infinite Pharaoh of the desert wasteland of Khemhara, now the Ultralich. Khorsekef intends to return to Orden and sit once again on his throne in the grand Heliopolis at the center of Khemhara—and he has a plan …",
      "THE TIMESCAPE IN YOUR GAME": "['We use the timescape and its medieval fantasy land Orden as the default setting presented in these books. Doing so makes it easier for us as designers to marry our design with real examples from a real (imaginary) fantasy world. We also think it’s easier for you to take the names for places, languages, and gods, and replace them with your own. We might reference some hero or villain, saint or god, whose name makes you think, “Well, I don’t have that in my setting.” If we do a good job, though, you might be inspired to say, “But that makes me think …” And being inspired is part of the fun!', 'If you’re the Director, you can use as many or as few of the details of the timescape as you like. You might wish to create your own world within the timescape, or use a setting you’ve created that exists outside of the official MCDM manifolds. You can use details from settings published by other companies. There are no rules when it comes to world-building. Feel free to take what you like from this book and change the rest. For example, you might not care for our dwarves having literal stone skin. That’s fine. You can make them fleshy, stout, bearded folk, or mohawked, barrel-chested punk rockers, or anything else you wish. As long as you’re running a heroic fantasy campaign about fighting monsters, then the game’s rules are still likely to serve your narrative even if that narrative deviates from ours.', 'If you’re a player, ask your Director about the setting where the game takes place and discuss with them the sort of hero you want to create. Maybe you want to play a more traditional gruff and bearded dwarf rather than go all short and stony. An open dialogue and honest discussion with your Director can lead to everyone getting what they want out of the game.']"

  "MAKING A HERO": {
    "YOUR FIRST SESSION": "Getting together with your friends to make characters can be a lot of fun. Many groups spend most of their first session talking about the campaign’s story, making heroes, and going over expectations for the game. It’s a great way to kick off a long-term campaign.\n\nThe Director should make an agenda for a campaign’s first session—often called “session zero”—which can include any of the following items:\n\n['The Director and players talk about the safety tools they want to employ at the game table (whether physical or virtual), so that everyone has a good time and understands which topics should be avoided in the game’s narrative and which should be embraced. For more information, check out the MCDM Tabletop Safety Toolkit at mcdm.gg/SafetyToolkit, which includes advice for running a successful session zero.', 'The Director discusses the campaign’s world and the major story themes they want to introduce into the game.', 'The players get a chance to tell the Director what they would like to see in the campaign. This can include anything from “I’d love to play out some chase scenes!” to “I want to explore themes of loss and grief.” These wishes should be starting points for a conversation. If not all players are comfortable with certain themes or content requested by other players, then session zero is a great time to discuss that and come to a consensus about what everyone wants out of the game.', 'Make heroes! Once everyone understands what the campaign is about, it’s the perfect time to get into character creation. When a group of players make heroes together, they can tie backstories together and strategize to build a tactically dominant party both in and out of combat.', 'The Director runs an encounter to kick off the campaign. If all the players have the time, it’s totally worth it to get some play in during the first session, even if it’s just a quick brawl in a tavern with some cultists! Giving the players a little action lets them see what the game is all about—and leaves them excited for the next session.']",
    "STEP-BY-STEP HERO MAKING": {
      "1. THINK": "The first thing you should do is think about the kind of hero you want to make. Ask yourself the following questions:\n\n['Do you fight with weapons, magic, psionics, or some combination of these abilities?', 'Outside of combat, what do you want your hero to do well?', 'What did you do before becoming a hero?', 'Why did you choose to become a hero?', 'What is your personality like?', 'What people, places, and objects are important to you?', 'How will your hero complement the strengths and weaknesses of the other heroes?']",
      "2. ANCESTRY": "Choose your hero’s humanoid ancestry from among the range of ancestries available in the game—devil, dragon knight, dwarf, hakaan, high elf, human, memonek, orc, polder, revenant, time raider, or wode elf. Future supplements will introduce additional ancestries you can choose from. See *Ancestries* for more information.\n\n*(Playtest note: A selection of the game’s full range of ancestries are currently available, some of which feature lore entries.)*",
      "3. CULTURE": "Create your hero’s culture. Although ancestry gives your hero a number of physiological benefits, your culture describes the community that raised you and gives you languages and skills. See *Culture* for more information.",
      "4. CAREER": "Choose your hero’s career, which describes what you did for a living before you became a hero. Your career gives you skills and a title, and might also give you languages, Renown, or knowledge for crafting and research. See *Careers* for more information.",
      "5. CLASS": "Choose your hero’s class. This choice has the biggest impact on how your hero interacts with the rules of the game, especially the rules for combat. Your class provides your characteristic scores and Stamina, in addition to skills, several abilities, and other benefits. You can be a censor, conduit, elementalist, fury, null, shadow, tactician, talent, or troubadour. See *Classes* for more information.\n\n*(Playtest note: The currently available classes are the conduit, elementalist, fury, shadow, and tactician, each of which includes only 1st-level features.)*",
      "6. KIT": "Choose your hero’s kit. Your kit provides you with equipment and a fighting style that grants a signature ability and bonuses to one or more of your game statistics.",
      "7. ADD FREE STRIKES": {
        "description": "Every hero has the ability to make free strikes under certain circumstances—extra attacks that don’t require your action. (You can also make a free strike as an action on your turn, though you’ll usually have better options for your action.)

      "8. COMPLICATION": "Your hero experienced an event that has left them with a benefit and a drawback. Complications are optional, so check with your Director to make sure your game is using them. See *Complications* for more information.",
      "9. DETERMINE DETAILS": "Once you’ve created your hero, it’s time to determine the additional details of their backstory, appearance, and personality. How do the events of their culture, career, inciting incident, and class tie together into a cohesive narrative? What’s their name? What do they look like? Do they have any cool scars? Any dope tattoos? Do they still sleep with their teddy bear? These sorts of details can help define a well-rounded hero.",
      "10. MAKE CONNECTIONS": "Ask the Director if all the heroes start the campaign knowing each other. If they do, talk to the other players and build some connections between your heroes. If you like, you can use the following prompts to make those connections, or to come up with prompts of your own:\n\n['While fighting a monster, another hero saved your life. What were you battling and who saved you?', 'In your group, who looks after everyone’s health and well-being and makes sure that all the characters get along? If it’s not you, how do you view this other hero?', 'Who is the grumpiest member of your party? If it isn’t you, how do you react to that hero’s sour nature? If it is you, how do you react to other characters teasing you or trying to cheer you up?', 'What’s one thing your fellow heroes know about you that other people do not?', 'What’s your favorite way to bond with your fellow heroes?', 'You’ve known one of the other heroes in your party longer than the rest. Who is it, and how did you meet?', 'Another hero creates food, music, clothing, trinkets, or something else that you enjoy. Who is that hero and what do they make?', 'Another hero is teaching you a new skill. Who is it, and what are they teaching you?']\n\nAnswer these questions with the other players present, and be sure to get a player’s approval if your answer makes use of their character.",
      "CHOOSING SKILLS": "['This game has lots of skills, and lots of opportunities during character creation to gain them. We recommend recording a list of all the skills you might gain from the different steps of the character creation process, then making your choices at the end of that process rather than flipping back and forth through the book.', 'If you gain the same specific skill from two different sources (for instance, from a career and a class), you can pick a different skill from the same skill group. See *Skills* for more information.']"
    },
    "CHANGING CHARACTER OPTIONS": "If you pick a skill, ability, class, or any other option that you end up not liking after using it in the game—even your character’s ancestry—you can always freely change that option between game sessions. If you want to change an option during a session, ask your Director. If they say it’s fine to swap that option out for something else, go for it.",

        "MILESTONE": "Rather than tracking XP, some games see the heroes advance in level when they achieve a particular story milestone. For example, when a party defeats the main villain of an adventure and foils their dastardly plot, each hero gains a level for achieving this objective, no matter how many or few obstacles they faced along the way.\n\nFor many Directors using milestone advancement, the end of each adventure within a campaign serves as a milestone for leveling up. The Director can share these milestones with the players to encourage them to work toward particular goals, and to engage with the story and world the Director has prepared. For example, in a campaign where the heroes have to face nine evil mages, it makes sense that each time the heroes defeat a mage, they gain a level. The Director should keep milestone goals flexible, though. Defeating a mage could mean stopping them with violence, using negotiation to make them stand down, or anything else that thwarts their evil plans.",
        "DIRECTOR SAYS SO": "Some games don’t track XP or goals at all. The heroes simply gain a level whenever the Director decides it’s appropriate for the story."

  "ANCESTRIES": {
    "ON THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES": "Orden is a fantasy world. It works on principles similar to those many people throughout history believed governed the real world. \"I dunno, a god did it probably.\"\n\nHumans, elves, orcs, dwarves, dragons—all have creator gods—the elder gods, four of whom made the world for some reason. Maybe they were bored.\n\nThe fashion among those gods for creating new, intelligent species petered after the orcs. Once humans came along and invented war, it stopped being fun.\n\nIt may be all species were created by gods. That’s certainly what a lot of people throughout our own history assumed. Orden has no Darwin and probably won’t ever. There’s still inheritance. People expect children to look like their parents, but there aren’t evolutionary pressures except on a very local scale.\n\nAnd in a world where powerful, world-altering magics are available, mortals sometimes try to recreate the gods' efforts. Some succeed, and new intelligent, speaking peoples are born.\n\nHowever, mortals are not gods and lack their ineffable wisdom. They are, in fact, very effable. Many have sought the power to create. It is available to any sorcerer of near-godlike power with the right rituals, though these days that power is very obscure. Creating new intelligent species was easier for mortal wizards back in the youth of the world when magic was friskier.\n\nIn every instance in recorded history, attempts by mortals to make obedient servitor species backfire. The steel dwarves worked marvels with valiar, the truemetal, and the miracle mineral prismacore that grants objects a semblance of life. Eventually, their science and magics produced the omnivok, machines that were self-aware. Perhaps uniquely, when the dwarves realized they had created beings equal to themselves, they stopped their work and gave their creation full rights and independence, preferring to work with them rather than attempt, and inevitably fail, to be their masters.\n\nNormally, it doesn’t work out that nicely. Even with the best of intentions, things go awry. The Dragon Phalanx were created by Good King Omund’s wizard Vitae to be the perfect knights, dispensing justice throughout the lands. But the same sorceries that grant self-awareness also grant independence. Agency. And though they enjoyed thirty years of peace and justice, eventually the dragon knights were betrayed by one of their own, seduced by the power offered by Ajax.\n\nThe law of unintended consequences applies to the just and the unjust alike.\n\nUsually when some powerful being tries to create an intelligent people, it’s for less than virtuous reasons. The synliroi are responsible for several intelligent species in the timescape, each an attempt to create a perfectly obedient servitor species. The most notorious example are the kuran’zoi, the time raiders who rebelled almost immediately and carry a burning hate for the voiceless talkers to this day.\n\nA perhaps less egregious use of this power is called quickening. Used when a powerful mage lives in and amongst some clever species just on the cusp of self-awareness. These instances, which are much more numerous than creating a new species from whole cloth, are more like the concept of uplifting found in science fiction. The mage or witch or shaman didn’t create anything. They just gave these cute, clever, frog-things a little boost. A little nudge. And suddenly there are angualotls walking around having conversations with each other, wondering when someone will invent a fabric that doesn’t get moldy in the swamp.\n\nThis also carries serious ethical repercussions! “You didn’t create angualotls! You screwed up some perfectly good frogs! Look at them, you gave them anxiety!”\n\nThis is only how it works on Orden. You may have completely different explanations for why there are several different intelligent species walking around in your world. Or no explanation! Or competing and irreconcilable theories on the matter! Use whatever inspires you.\n\nAt the end of the day, if you throw out all of this and replace it with something you made up, it will be better. Because it’s *yours*!",

      "ON DEVILS": "Adelard scuttled across the floor of his basement, a heavy tome clutched in one hand, his index finger marking a page. Occasionally he would stop, open the book, consult a diagram, look at the chalk markings he’d made on the floor, tilt his head, then bend down and refine or rub out an esoteric symbol.\n\nOne of the red candles suddenly guttered out, making the small room noticeably darker. “Damn and blast!” he hissed. Then he relit it from another candle.\n\nStepping back to admire his handiwork, Adelard crossed his arms and nodded. He’d spent his last coppers on the candles—they weren’t cheap. And he feared the skull might be fake, but did it matter? The book just said *a skull*—it didn’t even specify a human skull! Did it matter if it was real? It was probably real. What kind of market was there for replica skulls? But it was awfully cheap. Anyway, did it matter? How would the ritual know if the skull was real?\n\nHe was wittering, putting off the inevitable. He pulled himself together. It was either going to work, or it wasn’t, and wittering wasn’t going to help. He opened the book and turned the page—then began to speak the ritual.\n\nMoments later, the candles flared, there was a burst of flame, and acrid brimstone filled his nostrils. When the smoke cleared… there was a devil standing in his basement—dark purple skin, horns, even a twitching tail.\n\n“Aha! Yes, finally.” It rubbed its hands together. “It’s about time,” the creature said, pulling on the bottom of his waistcoat to straighten it. “Now then! How does it go? Oh, yes.” He cleared his throat. “On behalf of my lord, his grace Archduke Dispater, Lord of Dis, I am empowered to offer you…”\n\nBut his speech fell on deaf ears.\n\n“It worked!” Adelard said, holding his clenched fists up. “Ahahaha! It worked! Finally, after years! I will have my revenge! Hahaha…!” *cough* *cough* Adelard was suddenly gripped by a coughing fit, but he kept crowing. “Dismiss me from service, will they?! *cough* Old and useless… am I?! I’ll show them!” He coughed again, fighting to breathe now. “I will hex them and torture them until they…”\n\nHe stopped cavorting and capering, and his eyes went wide. “Until they… until…” He clutched his chest.\n\n“Uh-oh,” the devil said, genuinely worried.\n\n“HNNG!” Adelard grunted. Then he collapsed to the ground, curled into a fetal position, obviously in immense pain.\n\n“Nono. Nurse!” the devil called out. “Doctor!? Is anyone… you should lie down. Well, you are lying down. Do some… some deep-breathing exercises. Have a cup of tea! That always…”\n\nAdelard gasped one last time and uncurled, muscles relaxed. Eyes open but unseeing.\n\n“…calms me down,” the devil said quietly.\n\nSuddenly, the candles were extinguished as one, plunging the room into pitch-blackness. The devil’s hellsight meant this was only a minor inconvenience for him. “Um,” he said to the empty room. “Uh-oh.”\n\nHe poked the tip of his boot at the chalk symbol surrounding him on the floor. Nothing happened. He stepped on it. Nothing happened. He put his weight on that foot. No alarms went off.\n\nHe walked out of the circle. Nothing happened. No one, it seemed, cared.\n\nA few moments later, the door to a small home, little more than a wooden shack on the outskirts of a small village, opened. A well-dressed devil peeked out and then slowly emerged, stepping onto the dirt road that led through the center of the village. A keep stood atop a hill in the distance.\n\n“Ah,” the devil said.\n\nA wide woman dressed in wool, carrying a pile of clean clothes, saw him and stopped in her tracks, her mouth open.\n\n“Oh! Good day to you, madam, I wonder if you could tell me…”\n\n“AAAHHHHH!!!” she screamed. For quite a long time. Then she dropped her laundry and ran.\n\n“Ah. Um. Hmm.”\n\nA young man in a low, stone building saw this exchange, grabbed what looked like a long iron poker, and ran out to confront the new arrival.\n\n“Have at you, devil!” he said, assuming something like a dueling pose.\n\n“I say! Steady on!” The devil raised his hands.\n\nThe two of them stood there, frozen in the middle of the street for a few moments.\n\nThen the devil turned and ran away as quickly as he could.\n\n“And that’s how I ended up here!” Riyalkin toasted his dinner companion. “Now, after years of obscurity, a legendary hero!”\n\n“Legendarily vain,” his dinner guest teased with a smile.\n\n“Simply playing my part, darling. People expect a certain amount of vanity in a troubadour, don’t they?”\n\nShe laughed. “Riyalkin the Red Pen is every bit as advertised.”\n\n“Thank you. And besides, accusations of vanity are a bit rich coming from my leading lady.”\n\n“Not all actors are vain.” She took offense beautifully. “Just the good ones.” She sipped her drink.\n\n“Well then, you must be very vain indeed,” the devil said.\n\n“Anyway, does that answer your question?”\n\n“Mostly. Do they speak Caelian in hell?”\n\n“What a good question. Unless it’s very old, the ritual usually grants knowledge of the summoner’s language. I gather in the bad old days, we used to just show up in a cloud of brimstone and gabble at people. I’m sure it was impressive, but what did it achieve? Not very professional, I can tell you that.”\n\n“No cloud of brimstone now?” she teased.\n\nHe waggled his eyebrows. “Style counts for something.”\n\n“But wait, that was….” She did some quick mental math. “Fifteen years ago?”\n\n“Well, I was an accountant here in Capital for several years in between.”\n\n“An accountant!”\n\nRiyalkin shrugged. “It’s what I did before. I’m moderately good at it.”\n\n“And how does one go from being an alien accountant to a famous troubadour?”\n\n“Well…” Riyalkin seemed uncomfortable suddenly. “It’s just that… the thing is, accountancy in the Seven Cities is just so much more interesting than it is here. Plotting and scheming, always on the lookout for an assassin, people constantly trying to claw their way up the ladder, usually over your dead body. And I guess I just… missed the excitement.”\n\n“The excitement of being an accountant.”\n\n“The excitement of being an accountant in Hell,” Riyalkin said. “In any event, enough about me and the thrill of double-entry bookkeeping. Perhaps you can enlighten me. Why is it, in spite of my impeccable taste and the outrageous sums I spend looking good, I always feel underdressed in your presence? Do you employ sorcery? Or is it that any outfit is improved by your unearthly beauty?”\n\nShe blushed in spite of herself and raised her own glass in a toast.\n\n“You silver-tongued devil.”",

    "DRAGON KNIGHT": {
      "ON THE DRAGON KNIGHTS": "The cloaked figure at the back of the inn stood up. As they did so, their hood slipped down, revealing their head and face. A susurration rippled through the crowd. One man standing near the bar dropped his jaw, followed by his flagon of mead.\n\nA tall, broad draconian stepped into the light. He was old, his scales battle-scarred. He rested one clawed hand on the pommel of a mace that hung from a loop on his belt, while the other carried his shield by a strap. His flat, expressionless look was more terrifying than any threatening glower.\n\nThe three human bandits took a step back. One of the dwarves just sneered—then, sensing his human compatriot’s reluctance, turned to look at them. “What’s this?” the lead dwarf growled.\n\n“Don’t be cowards now!” the other dwarf said, a hint of joy in his voice. “Look what a prize we have caught!”\n\n“We didn’t…” one bandit said, shaking. “We didn’t know…”\n\nLooking at the dragon knight, the other bandit added quickly, “We didn’t know there was one of you here.”\n\nThe draconian didn’t move. Didn’t give any indication he heard the man. Just stared unblinking at the lead dwarf.\n\n“Think of the bounty,” the dwarf hissed to the humans, but he kept his eye on the draconian. “We’ll all be rich.”\n\n“I don’t…” One of the bandits dropped her sword and held her hands up as she backed away from the group toward the exit. “I don’t need it that bad,” she said. Then she turned and ran out the door. Her human compatriots followed.\n\nThe two dwarves surveyed the tavern. The people were now all facing them. A few had stood up. They weren’t afraid anymore.\n\n“We’ll be back,” the lead dwarf said, and the two of them backed out of the inn, sheathing their shortswords before they turned and left.\n\nAs one, the people in the tavern turned to look with undisguised awe at the dragon knight. He noticed this, ducked his head to avoid their gaze. “Show’s over,” he growled, then he turned to go back to his seat in the rear.\n\n“Thank you,” the woman behind the bar said. “Thank you for…”\n\nShe stopped when she saw the draconian was ignoring her.\n\nA short, doughty, middle-aged man stood up, and two equally doughty women at the same table stood up with him. “Excuse me, sir knight,” the man said as the dragon knight walked past their table.\n\nThe knight moved on, ignoring them. The man reached out and grabbed the massive draconian’s arm. The knight wheeled on the peasant, looming over him.\n\nThe man bowed his head and touched his forelock. The two women with him curtseyed and tried to avoid making eye contact.\n\n“Begging your pardon, sir, but we been lookin’ for you.”\n\nThe dragon knight sneered and bared a set of sharp teeth. “Look for someone else,” he growled as he pulled his arm away.\n\nThe man scurried around to stand in front of the draconian, blocking his way. He took off his worn cap and held it over his breast. “I’m sorry sir, but there ain’t no one else. And there’s this new tax, you see, from the new baron. And a priest says he’s of Saint Ajax.”\n\nThe knight bared his impressive teeth, ready to scare Jago and the other two away—when someone else spoke.\n\n“You might want to hear ’em out, Vaant,” said a voice from the table the three peasants had been sitting at.\n\nThe dragon knight turned sharply to look at the man who’d spoken. His back was to the draconian, but the voice gave him away.\n\n“John?”\n\nThe man turned to look up.\n\n“Hi Vaant,” he said, smiling. He rose from the table. He was middle-aged, fit. Black hair hung down to his shoulders. He was armed with many weapons, looked like a captain of the guard. “Folks,” he said, “this is Vaantikalisax, Knight of King Omund in the Thunder Phalanx. He may be the last of the Storm Knights.”\n\nThe man held out his hand. The dragon knight looked at it for a moment before reaching out slowly to grasp it. “What are you doing out here?” Vaantikalisax asked.\n\n“These people need help. I said I’d find it. Heard a rumor someone matching your description was holed up here having a drinking contest with Mr. John Barleycorn.”\n\nThe draconian sniffed, released John’s hand, and looked at the three peasants. “Why do you people need me? You’re in the company of Sir John, Commander of the Fifth …”\n\n“Just John,” Sir John said, holding a hand up. “The new baron stripped me of my title. My lands.”\n\n“I didn’t know that.” The draconian’s voice softened. “I’m sorry.”\n\n“I’ll be fine. But these people…” John said, gesturing to the three older peasants. Vaantikalisax waved him to silence.\n\n“Sure,” he said. “But why me?”\n\n“Thought maybe you’d like to get back in the game.”\n\n“The game.”\n\n“Yeah.” Sir John smiled. “The hero game.”\n\nVaantikalisax said nothing. The inn had mostly gone back to its business but the three peasants watched intently. Eventually, the dragon knight spoke again, his voice low.\n\n“I owe you a lot, John—but not everything.”\n\n“I’m not asking everything.”\n\n“No, that’s not how it starts. But I have this feeling that’s how it’ll end.”\n\n“What does your oath say? ‘Even should the sun stop in the sky, even should the night—’ ”\n\n“John,” the dragon knight said, his voice suddenly sad. Exasperated. “You don’t want to quote my oath to me. You really don’t. I liked serving with you. I have fond memories of that time—of you. Don’t spoil it.” He looked at his friend, the three peasants, then shook his head and turned to leave the inn.\n\n“Vaant,” Sir John said, following. “Sir Vaantikalisax, by your oath!”\n\nThe dragon knight stopped and spun around. Everyone in the inn was watching the show again. Act two.\n\n“The people need leadership,” John said as he looked at all the folk watching.\n\nVaantikalisax’s reptile eyes flashed in anger. “They had it. Thirty years, and what did it amount to?! I watched Ajax… I watched him…” The dragon knight’s eyes flinched. His clawed hands tightened on his mace and shield. “I watched the oath… fail.”\n\n“Vaant… Vaant, the Dragon Phalanx didn’t fail. You were betrayed. It was Mandrake! One of your own, don’t you get it? You’re just as fallible as the rest of us. You were never ‘incorruptible.’ It’s just what we wanted to believe. You’re just people—like the rest of us.”\n\nThe dragon knight looked at the people around him, at the three peasants desperate for someone, anyone, to help them. Then he looked back to his friend.\n\n“Exactly,” Vaantikalisax said. Then he turned and left the inn.",

    "DWARF": {
      "ON DWARVES": "There’s nothing a team of dwarves can’t do! Five dwarves alone can easily kill a dragon. Ten dragons![^1] Why, Vorka the Fell-Handed alone slew five dragons at the Siege of Var Loska before succumbing to her wounds. One dwarf! Think what a small, dedicated party of dwarves could do!\n\nThere aren’t many of the great dragons left, alas, so we must … I mean, dwarves must content themselves with fighting lesser evils. Necromancers, tyrants. Folks who cheat at dice.\n\nDwarves take the long view. Well, so do elves, but elves seem more interested in preserving things. Dwarves want to make things! Improve the world! “The world is fine the way it is …” Shut up! No it’s not! The world is full of pain, misery, injustice. We cannot make a perfect world, but we can strive to improve the one we’ve got!\n\nAnyway. Humans make too much of this so-called rivalry between dwarves and elves. Yes, it was an elf army that slew the last steel dwarves in the War Against Night, but that was tens of thousands of years ago. And anyway, those were the shadow elves, long banished to the World Below. And none now live who remember those days.\n\nThe steel dwarves—the greatest of us—are dead now, and our cousins the fire dwarves left this world for Quintessence long ago. There they built Alloy, the City of Brass, the City at the Center of the Timescape. A marvel! Not so large as Capital, perhaps, but not so … fragrant either.\n\nIt is left to us, the stone dwarves, the Last Children of Ord, to work stone, create great marvels with it. Our greatest days are not behind us! Who speaks thus?! Have we not been to the Hanging City of Kal Kalavar together? Will you ever forget that place? I will not should I live to be a thousand, and neither will you. And it was finished in my lifetime. Only three hundred years ago! It’s brand new!\n\nElven rivalry. Pagh! Did we not name the most precious metal in the earth \"valiar\" after their god Val? Val is a noble god, a worthy patron of the elves. He seeks justice and glory in his own way, we deem. Were one to choose the path of the conduit, you could pick worse gods than Val to serve.\n\nIt is the humans who make so much of rivalries between the ancestries. It was the humans who called us “dwarves.” We do not know the significance of this word in their tongue, but we accept it. Their speech is crude, true, but they are a young species after all. We must not judge them too harshly. “Elemental” would be a faithful translation of our word for ourselves into the Caelian tongue.\n\nAh, the record of dwarven achievement is long … too long to tell in so short a space. And it is not seemly to compare ourselves so. This entry spends many words on elves and men as though we were competitors, but who says it? Why should it be thus? Was it a dwarf who slew Baalorak the Griefbringer? No! It was the Crown of Nine Stars! That legendary company of heroes who counted three dwarves among their number, but also elves and orcs and humans. Like the great cosmopolitan city of Alloy, we are stronger together.\n\nLook you again at the Hanging City. Yes, your eyes well with tears from the magnificence of it, but see it clearly. Is it a dwarven city? Everyone calls it thus, but do you know how many humans live there? Thousands. And orcs. And elves! Of course! How else should it be?\n\nSome say the greatest ages of the world are behind us, but this is not so. Not so. While there is yet will in the world, there is greatness. You will see. The elves, the orcs. Humans and dwarves. All the speaking peoples have wonder in them yet. Our greatest days are ahead. Did not Ord make the world?\n\nNone of us ask to come into this world, and apart from the Hakaan, none of us know how we will leave it. But remember, you are a dwarf. You have it in you to work marvels. To change the world, be you a holy conduit of Valak-koth the Peacebringer, one of the talented Mind Masters of the White Gem, a beastheart of the Darkdivers seeking through the World Below for deep knowledge, or a master tactician of the Imperial War College in Capital. You will make a better world.\n\nYou are young yet, but already those who work evil deeds should fear you. You are a dwarf. You have a great destiny ahead.\n\n[^1]: This is what happens when you let a dwarven troubadour write the dwarf entry.",

    "ELF, WODE": {
      "ON WODE ELVES": "“I’m scared,” Wenna said. “We should go back.” The forest felt as if it was closing in on them.\n\n“We’re not going back,” Jeremy said. Normally, such a statement would be the end of the discussion, but they were alone and far from home.\n\n“What if we’re going in circles?”\n\n“Then we keep going in circles!” Dade said from somewhere up ahead. “Until we find the elves.”\n\n“The elves have found you!” a clear, bright voice called out. The children froze. They scanned the wood, but there were no signs of the speaker.\n\nThen, only a few feet from them, a half-dozen figures melded out of the background, as if the trees and bushes and grass had been painted on them to perfectly match the wode. They wore light armor covered in leaves, moss, and vines, and they bristled with weapons.\n\n“Black gods!” Meliora gasped. Credan frowned, and Wenna hushed her for swearing. Dade was ushered back toward them by two more wode elves, his bow in hand. The children huddled together, Credan’s hand on the symbol of Saint Gryffyn around his neck, and Jeremy’s hand on the hilt of his sword.\n\nThe elves were tall, taller than an adult human, but seemed always to crouch as soon as they stopped moving. Their eyes were unsettling, widely spaced and huge. But it was their ears, long and tall and twisting and set with great scoops to catch all sound, that marked them as elves of the wode.\n\n“Admittedly, though, most terrans regret the experience.”\n\nThe voice they had heard called out again—from above. The children looked up and now saw a wode elf with long, furry, twisting ears and nut-brown skin smiling down at them. They were wearing a brightly colored outfit. The children watched the elf leap lightly from branch to lower branch until finally landing with a flourish on the forest floor before them.\n\n“Consort!” An elf before them spoke in Yllyric as he stood from his crouch and bowed. “We have been tracking these since they entered the wode.”\n\nMeliora, who understood the words, whispered to the others. “They called that one ‘consort!’ ”\n\nLlyander smiled, looking from Meliora to the elf who had just addressed them with a **See? I told you!** look on their face.\n\nThe tall, swashbuckling elf bowed to the children. “I am Llyander, the Lightning Strike, Consort to Queen Imyrr.” They indicated the elf who had spoken. “This is my cousin, Rhythylthin.”\n\n“How did you know we were here?” Jeremy asked. Dade stood just behind him, with an arrow now nocked.\n\nThe one called Rhythylthin reached out while Dade was turned, looking at the queen’s consort, and deftly plucked the arrow from the young man’s bow.\n\n“Nothing happens within the wode without our knowledge,” the elf said. Dade spun on him and nocked another arrow. “And approval,” Rhythylthin added, closing his hand and snapping the arrow in it.\n\n“You come bearing a gift for our queen—the Codex Dryadalis.” Llyander nodded at the heavy scroll Meliora carried. “My cousin Rhythylthin here was sent to capture you and escort you to the Orchid Court. But I am the queen’s consort, and have my own thoughts on the matter.”\n\nThe elf smiled at the children. “But have no fear,” they said. Their Vaslorian was perfect, their voice a song. “You are safe … now.” The pause before “now” spoke volumes.\n\n“Are you a … a … boy or a girl?” Wenna asked.\n\nLlyander smiled gaily. “I am a song! I contain melodies and harmonies alike,” they said. Wenna smiled.\n\nRhythylthin rolled his eyes. Llyander noticed this and winked at him. “Fashions change. My cousin here wears the new trends.” They gestured at the other wode elf’s garb and masculine appearance. “Me? I’m old-fashioned.” They gestured to their own outfit and appearance. “Grace never goes out of style.”\n\nLlyander turned to Rhythylthin and the rest of the wode elf band. “Their gift goes to Lord Tear, methinks. I will escort them.” Then, suddenly imperious, they added, “You may go.”\n\nIn spite of his previous skepticism toward the queen’s consort, Rhythylthin straightened and bowed. As one, the elves turned and flowed into the wode. In only a few steps, they melded into the trees and undergrowth.\n\n“How did they do that?” Meliora demanded, spinning to confront their benefactor.\n\n“Hmm? Do what?” Llyander asked, looking after the elves, wondering what Meliora meant.\n\n“Just … disappear like that!”\n\nLlyander looked at the other children with a combination of wonder and annoyance. “Do terran children not play hiding games?”\n\n“Well …” Jeremy looked at Dade, who was no help. “We do, but …”\n\nLlyander made a theatrical, dismissive gesture with one arm. “Well, it is the same thing, then. But for our people, it is a game we practice all our lives! We would be poor protectors of the wode if we could not conceal ourselves within it.”\n\n“But that was …” Meliora was frustrated at the elf’s seeming evasion. “That was magic!”\n\n“You say? Well,” Llyander mused, “terrans are a part and apart, it is said. It is your blessing and your curse methinks. Perhaps someday you can explain it to me!” The elf’s eyes twinkled at Meliora’s frustration.\n\nLlyander turned and marched off. “Come!” they called. The children ran to catch up.\n\n“Where are we going?” Wenna asked.\n\n“I enjoy the favor of Lord Tear,” Llyander said. “We are old friends. With me as your guide, he will treat you well—likely bestow favor upon you! You should be in anticipation of great treasure.” They smiled.\n\nThe elf stopped suddenly and spun toward them, serious but kindly. They pointed to each of the children in turn.\n\n“I will instruct you on the proper etiquette, but remember this: Lord Tear will test us. Some tests for you and some for me. The high elves and the wode elves are but distant cousins. You will hear much that is polite, much that is flattering, but it is all another kind of glamor. It hides deep tensions, recently exacerbated by the treaty with Ajax.”\n\nThe children nodded. The elf, satisfied, marched off and they followed.\n\nJeremy turned to Dade. “I feel like we’re in a dream,” he whispered.\n\n“You are!” their escort called out. “The wode is a dream! With a little luck, one you may soon wake safely from.”",

    "ELF, HIGH": {
      "ON HIGH ELVES": "“They’re so beautiful,” Wenna said. “It’s hard to imagine we’re in danger.”\n\n“It’s not that hard,” Dade said darkly.\n\nThe five children stood alone in the center of a large circular courtyard open to the sky, their wode elf escort Llyander at their side. Lord Tear, King of the High Elves, sat on a marble throne, holding the scroll of the Codex Dryadalis in his lap. He had not spoken since Llyander made their speech and handed the codex over. The members of the court, nobles and courtiers and learned sages, gathered to watch. Implacable warriors in golden plate with fine filigree etched into the metal stood guard around the perimeter. They bristled with weapons.\n\n“They seem like …” Meliora said, searching for the words.\n\n“Like the lords of all the world,” Wenna said with awe and wonder.\n\n“And we are their prisoners,” Jeremy said, looking at his brother Dade and Credan beside him.\n\n“You’re not prisoners,” Llyander said quietly. “You are guests. You’re safer here than you would be even in your own homes.”\n\n“Yes,” Jeremy said, looking at the nearest guards with their longspears and swords. “We feel very safe.”\n\n“Who are you kidding?” Dade said. “Everyone knows how much elves hate humans.”\n\nAt this, Lord Tear exchanged a look with Llyander, consort to Queen Imyrr. It was a knowing look, full of sadness and melancholy. Then he broke his silence.\n\n“Show me an elf who hates humans,” he said, his voice deep and sonorous, “and I will show you an elf who loved a human and watched them grow old and die.” He looked at the children for the first time and smiled a melancholy smile. “Love is like sunlight for us, you see. We love completely but rarely. The loss of it means an eternity of grief for us.”\n\nThe king tapped the scroll against his lap, seeming to have reached a decision.\n\n“Well done, consort. Young humans, your escort here seeks to shame me. For they know well they could have taken this prize to their queen and earned her favor. Instead, Llyander brought it to me in the hopes that by doing so, they deliver me the power necessary to throw off the yoke of Ajax’s rule. Long has Llyander resented the decision I made and sought to change it …” He looked at Llyander. “… by changing my mind.”\n\nLlyander nodded deferentially, silently congratulating the king on his insight.\n\n“Alas, your escort’s efforts are for naught.” Then the king’s face became softer. He held up the heavy scroll. “But this is not nothing,” he said. “We made a treaty with Ajax to deliver unto him any artifacts our search teams discover from the ruins of this city. He benefits from this bargain more than we. But this, methinks, will stay with us. It was written by my mother in the youth of the world, and there are some things which must be denied the Iron Saint, even should they violate the treaty.”\n\nLlyander turned to the children and smiled brilliantly, eyebrows waggling in a show of glee. Wenna and Credan couldn’t help but smile. “Well, you see, children?” Llyander said. “We only have more to do, not everything to do.”\n\nThe king stood up and a herald beside the throne announced, “Gather ye, and attend! The Lord of Fallen Irranys, Morning Dew On a Single Leaf Like a Tear from the Sun, speaks. And know his word is law!”\n\nLord Tear glided down the steps until he was standing, as tall as Llyander, before the children. His face was noble and beautiful. Wisps of silver-like strands of smoke spread across his golden skin. He seemed at once eternal and youthful.\n\n“You have heard many things about my people, but this above all you should know. We do not value lore for lore’s sake, but beauty first and above all other things. And the truth, to us, is a kind of beauty. Thus do we find knowledge beautiful.\n\n“You have returned something not only of enormous worldpower, but at the same time, a work of art my mother labored over for many of your centuries. It is something of a miracle that it is returned to me now. I will not forget this. You have made an ally of the lord of the high elves. And though you lead brief lives, while you live, you shall have the favor of the elves.” He turned to hand the scroll over to a sage and confer with his herald.\n\n“He seems wise,” Credan said.\n\n“And smart,” Meliora said.\n\n“I’m surprised how kind he is,” Jeremy said. “He seems a good king.”\n\nLlyander chuckled. Wenna noticed. She didn’t say anything at first, but eventually, she couldn’t resist. “What?”\n\nLlyander raised an eyebrow, then walked in front of the children so that as the wode elf spoke, their back was to the king.\n\n“Do you remember when my cousin’s soldiers hid in the wode?” they said, their voice low. “How astonished you were?”\n\nWenna and Meliora nodded. Llyander nodded to the guards and guests. “This is their glamor. Whatever you find pleasant and attractive in another? That is what you see in them. If you value good humor, they are jesters. If you value beauty, they are breathtaking. If you find intelligence attractive, they are sages. It is not just an effect of appearance, though it is also that. It is one of demeanor.”\n\n“But how do they do …” Meliora started.\n\nLlyander put a finger to their lips, silencing young Meliora. “It is not a thing they do. It is an effect in your mind.”\n\n“You mean they don’t even know they’re doing it?” Meliora asked.\n\n“Then what do they really look like?” Wenna asked.\n\nLlyander shrugged. “What does anyone really look like?” And while the other children chalked this up to their escort’s normally abstruse mode of communication, Meliora caught a glimpse of understanding somewhere in her mind.\n\nThe king turned back to them. “Should any of you seek hidden lore or deep wisdom, please allow me to serve you first. But you, young woman, the human child who learned our language, I name thee elf friend. And my naming carries power. You will find the learning of our lore will come more quickly to you, and all those who still revere the elves will give you safe passage in their lands.”\n\nLlyander put their hands on their hips and regarded the children. “Not bad for your second quest. What shall you do for an encore?”",

      "ON HAKAAN": "“You … you know when you’re going to die?”\n\nThe Pillar, dressed in her civilian clothing—a simple pleated dress cinched at the waist that left her bare arms free to work—dipped her hand in the pail of water. It immediately sprang to life, the water sizzled and danced as her fingers cooled. She pulled her hand out, shook off the water, and went back to sculpting the granite.\n\nThe hard, tough stone melded like clay under her fingers. Whatever she was doing, it generated enormous heat in her fingertips, hence the pails of water beside her. The Arrow couldn’t tell if this was her talent manifest, or something her people could do, or neither. As he watched, he realized he recognized the bust. It was the girl they rescued during the Society’s recent battle with the Academy.\n\n“Not exactly,” the Pillar said as she concentrated on her art. “Not when. More sort of …” She looked away from her sculpture and looked out the window, thinking. “How. Why. I am told there is a sense of …” she looked at the young man, a teenager, only recently recruited to the Society. “Anticipation. Eagerness when the time is nigh. So,” she took in a deep breath, which was an impressive sight to see in a 9-foot-tall woman, and let it out, smiling at the young man. “Not anytime soon.” Her smile was like a sunrise.\n\nThough he had lived with fear most of his young life, mortality was not something that plagued the Arrow’s mind. He had a hard time grasping it. “That must be … awful.”\n\n“Oh no,” she went back to her work. “No it’s … I do not know how to say it in Caelian. It is a blessing. I have seen people die for no reason. Be taken from their loved ones without warning, without … without purpose. There are unjust deaths. They destroy families. Communities.\n\n“But the doomsight only comes in time of great need. People forget Holkatja is also the goddess of luck, and those who beat luck—under … underdogs, as you say. She gave more than she stole, I sometimes think.\n\n“I do not know how long I have. No one does, but I know my death will have meaning. I know it, do you understand? I know it like I know my own name. Often I feel …” Her great hands clenched and unclenched, as though she were trying to grasp something just out of reach. “I yearn for it. I want it to happen. What greater end can there be than fulfilling one’s destiny?” She looked at the mostly-finished sculpture. “It gives everything I do a sense of purpose.” She went back to work.\n\n“My people are a serene and peaceful lot. We do not seek glory like the folk of Vanigar. But, in battle sometimes, knowing I am getting closer to my wyrd, my destiny, I think I know how they feel. Something comes over me, some enormous sense of … of rightness.” She smiled again at the young man. “It scares my friends sometimes, I know.”\n\nThe Arrow had seen it, and enthusiastically agreed.\n\n“You’re not from the Barrow Hills,” he said.\n\nThe Pillar shook her head. “No, I do not wot of your hills. I am from the hills north of the Blue Cloud Mountains in far Vanigar.” She turned and looked down at the Arrow with some pride. “My people are descended from the original Haka’an tribe.” She went back to work. “Though I am sure the Barrow Men, as you call them, are a fine people. We’re all related, you see.”\n\n“Is that why you joined the Society?”\n\n“Oh yes,” the Pillar said. “I had only left home a fortnight previous when Memory came to Vanigar to recruit me. I had a sense my wyrd lay in some distant land, but I did not know the world was so big.”\n\n“Did she look like herself?” the Arrow asked, smiling, enjoying a moment of shared experience with the giant woman.\n\nThe Pillar chuckled, and the Arrow’s chest vibrated with the force of it. “No, she looked like an agéd wise woman of Vanigar. I think only in fabled Alloy could the Memory of a Sunset at Dawn walk the streets without ‘scaring the horses,’ as they say.”\n\n“Alloy?”\n\nThe Pillar looked at the Arrow out of the corner of her eye. “You’ll see,” she said with some glee.\n\n“You were following your vision, you said.”\n\n“Yes, my wyrd as the Vanigair call it.”\n\n“What did you see?”\n\n“Oh,” she smiled and blushed, “it is not meet to say.”\n\n“It’s bad luck?”\n\n“Mmmm … you would say maybe. I think … rude is closer, but the doomsight is rarely clear in any event. It is full of symbolism and metaphor. My father is the shaa’er of our tribe. The skald as the Vanigair call it. He thought the symbolism was a kind of protection. So that I might know with certainty the meaning, but be unable to clearly convey it to others.” She nodded. “I think he is right.”\n\n“Is it like a dream or a nightmare?” The Arrow wasn’t sure how much it was okay to ask.\n\n“No, it was not a dream, it was a thing that happened.” She turned to face the Arrow and leaned her massive arms on her legs. “I know not how it is for other doomseekers, but this is how it was for me. I was collecting flecks of jasper, a … a mineral we add to our food. I was picking flakes of rock up off the ground when I saw a bee that could not fly and a horde of ants all around, one with wings. In that moment, that was all that I could see. It was like the rest of the world fell away, and the bee and the ants filled my sight. Though the bee was surrounded and the ants seemed to go on forever, I could see the ants were afraid. There were dozens of dead ants on the ground.”\n\n“What did you do?”\n\n“Mm?” The Pillar was lost for a moment, remembering the moment.\n\n“What happened next?”\n\nThe Pillar shrugged, giant muscles in her shoulders rippling. “That was the end of my vision. At that moment, I knew I had to leave home.”\n\n“Wow.”\n\n“Indeed. Its meaning is clear to me. I stand alone against the endless horde. In my heart, they are Ajax’s war dogs. I think I know this, but …” She shrugged again.\n\n“But how come you’re alone? Where am I? Where’s the Society?”\n\n“Who knows?” she smiled. “When the vision comes upon you, it is all you can see. Maybe it is like a painting, and I am the painter. And if only I could turn my head a little ways to the left or right, I would see my friends there, fighting with me. I like to think mine is a great sacrifice, made so my friends can escape some overwhelming evil. It is a common theme among the fated I am told.”\n\n“What about the bee? What happened to the bee?”\n\n“Oh, feeling sorry for it, I placed my finger gently on the ground, and you must see,” she held up her pinky, “even my little finger is like a mighty wall for the bee. I sought only to protect it from the ants, but it quickly scrambled onto my finger, and after I stood up, it cleaned itself and flew away.”\n\n“It could fly!” the Arrow said, suddenly full of youthful exuberance. “It could fly the entire time! It was just waiting … for someone else to come along.”\n\nThe Arrow stared, wide-eyed at the Pillar. Even before the young man spoke, the hakaan talent’s eyes widened in realization. “My vision …” she said.\n\n“Wasn’t over!” the Arrow said, his joy impossible to hide.",

      "ON HUMANS": "So, we arrive here at the end of your first semester of Human Culture. I hope to see you next year in the Caelian Empire course, and though it may be hard to believe now, I often see former students’ names in our textbooks years later. Perhaps that will be some of you.\n\nI will now answer the one question I am asked most often, and which I save answering until the last day of class: What do I think of humans?\n\nI am a high elf, as you deem it in your tongue. A child of the solar celestials. And I have taught this class, mostly to young humans, since the Caelian emperors founded this city. I was asked to join the faculty by the first chancellor. I have seen generations of your people come through this classroom, and that alone would well qualify me to answer this question.\n\nWhat do I think of humans? Well, I will tell you.\n\nI was here, teaching this class during the fire of Enlightenment 373. The fire leveled this city. Can you imagine that? Can you imagine the heat, the death, destruction that such a thing causes?\n\nSix months after the Great Fire, your ancestors had rebuilt… everything. I have seen many miracles in my life. Witnessing that feat might be chief among them.\n\nLiches are almost always humans. Did you know that? I think I know why. Your lives are so short—almost as soon as you’re born, you’re thinking about dying, and you refuse to yield.\n\nThat refusal to yield to death… to death… is what drives you, I think. Drives you to leave the world better than you found it. Causes ruined people to rebuild great city.\n\nWe studied human history in this room. Did you feel that those great ancestors of yours were perhaps made of finer stuff than you? Do not think thus. I knew them, and I know you, and your future is greater. I sometimes think each human generation greater than the last—more courageous, more generous. Quicker to forgive.\n\nToday, Ajax’s name is on everyone’s tongue, but I have seen many great evils arise in the world. I was teaching in this classroom when the Pharaoh Khorsekef, desperate, his power failing, opened the Great Tet and drank of the time stored there, becoming the Ultralich. He was defeated, and now rules the Necropolitan Ruin in the Abyssal Waste.\n\nI was alive, though not yet a professor, when Cthrion Uroniziir tried to reduce the timescape into one singular universe, wiping out reality as we know it. She was defeated, and we see her cage every day.\n\nEach of these great evils was defeated by a coalition. The armies and heroes of many speaking peoples. And all of them—all of them—were led… by humans. That’s a fact. That’s history. You can look it up.\n\nIs there some rare trait that makes you uniquely qualified to lead disparate peoples, bring them together to achieve great things? I think… there must be.\n\nThose great humans, your ancestors, did not focus on differences. They did not weigh different people and grade them based on arbitrary traits deemed virtues and flaws. That is what Ajax does. No, those humans focused on the future. On making a better world… for all of us. A world many of them knew they would not live to see. That is a sacrifice… I can scarcely imagine.\n\nThe people who stand against Ajax and tyrants like him will be just like you—normal people. Priests and scholars and merchants and farmers. Maybe even teachers.\n\nStopping Ajax will require you to become something else. You must become heroes. Conduits of saints, warmasters of great armies. Censors and shadows. That may seem unlikely now, but the future has a way of surprising us.\n\nSome of your names, I will see written in future textbooks.\n\nBut some of your names, I will see written in the stars.\n\n(Professor Cilliarwn did not elaborate on this.)",

      "ON MEMONEK": "“You want to tell me what just happened?” Sir John asked.\n\nCount Revile avoided his gaze, then turned and stamped away across the bloody battlefield.\n\n“I’m fine!” Revile shouted, all evidence to the contrary.\n\n“I know what I saw,” John said as he followed his friend. “You went into a bloodlust. And it’s not the first time. Whether you like it or not, whether I like it or not, I’m in charge of this mission. Either you tell me what’s going on, or I have no choice. I have to conclude you’re a danger to the team and cut you loose.”\n\nRevile stopped and turned to look at the rest of the party, recovering from their wounds. The memonek’s white porcelain chest heaved as he tried to calm himself. His ceramic skin looked as strong as plate, but John knew it was brittle, fragile.\n\nCount Revile took a deep breath. “We call it velloparatha,” he said. “In your tongue it would be … world-sick … or world-sickness? It is a thing that happens … to my people … when they come to your world. It is an illness of … of feeling. Emotion.”\n\n“Are you going mad?” John asked in a whisper.\n\nThe memonek smiled ruefully. “It feels that way sometimes. I spent an hour this morning staring at an insect that landed on my finger—a grasshopper, the polder called it. I thought I had never seen a thing so perfect and beautiful. That was awe. As powerful as I have ever felt. In the battle today, anger—just as powerful.\n\n“I thought I could resist it. When I arrived here and felt no different, I thought perhaps world-sickness was a legend. But it is a slow process, this illness, these insidious emotions.”\n\n“No emotions where you’re from?”\n\nCount Revile shook his head. “Not like this. We are creatures of reason, we of Axiom. It is our art, our pride—our religion sometimes, methinks. We have emotions. Joy, sadness, wonder, grief. Love. But they are… a fashion. They do not happen to us. They are something we indulge in, out of propriety. Here… everything is order and chaos mixed—even in me. In me.” Revile placed his hand on his chest.\n\n“In the battle today,” he said. “That anger was not directed at Ajax’s War Dogs. It was directed at myself.”\n\n“At yourself? Why? What did you—”\n\n“John,” the memonek said, and now it was his turn to whisper. “I was afraid. Afraid of … of being wounded, of failing you, failing my friends … of dying. And out of that fear came … enormous anger—at myself. Anger that I was so weak, so … useless. Anger so … strong, so powerful … I forgot who I was.”\n\nJohn chuckled. “That’s just …” He smiled broadly. “That’s normal, man. That’s just normal. We all feel that way.”\n\n“What? No, you don’t understand—”\n\n“Oh, I don’t understand? Okay, let me guess—it felt like you were gonna piss yourself.”\n\n“Yes!”\n\n“Yeah, happens to all of us.”\n\n“Even you?!”\n\nSir John shrugged. “Are you kidding? Sure. But it doesn’t help. You still got a job to do. In fact, I’d say that is the job. Anyone can learn the blade.” He placed his hand on the pommel of his sword. “Nothing special about that. It’s learning to deal with the fear. That’s the job—what separates the professionals from the amateurs.”\n\nCount Revile said nothing, just thinking.\n\n“Feeling better?”\n\nRevile nodded. “I always recover afterward, but these outbursts come unbidden, like thunder from a clear sky.”\n\n“Hmm. Yeah. Well, that explains what happened when you met Embers.”\n\nCount Revile did not like being reminded of that. He looked to the sky and shook his head. “I made a fool of myself.”\n\n“Don’t be so hard on yourself. If you’re trying to seduce our void mage, you made a good start of it. She’s three thousand years old, I’ve known her since I was fifteen. I don’t think I’ve ever seen her blush. Anyway, now that I know what’s going on, now that I know you’re basically a giant teenager with overactive glands, I can relax a little.”\n\nSir John and Count Revile, both tacticians, stood together on the bloody battlefield, looking at each other.\n\n“John, I fear this may get worse before it gets better.”\n\n“So, just like everything else?” He clapped the memonek on the shoulder. “Don’t worry, we’ll help you get through it. I’ll let the others know. Once they understand, they’ll help too. They’ll probably just take the piss out of you. That’ll help, you’ll love that.”\n\n“You’re a good friend, John.”\n\n“Heh. Is that you, or the world-sickness talking?”\n\n“Me, I think. The world-sickness would have me say … you’re a bastardly son of a bitch. But you’re my bastardly son of a bitch.” Count Revile smiled.\n\nJohn laughed and put his arm around his friend as they headed back to the party. “Funny. The world-sickness sounds a lot like me.”",

It was better before things started talking.\n\nAnd having opinions. About our creation. About us!\n\nOh, I don’t know. I thought I agreed, but then look you what our sibling Ord has made. A fine people, these elementals. They make marvels. Ord made them, and now they make miracles.\n\nWe make marvels. The world is a miracle, and enough.\n\nYes. But still. I think I might try my hand at children. It seems a worthy pursuit.\n\nHeed the lesson of our Shamèd Brother. It was better before the coming of the terrans. Before the coming of war.\n\nBut war has come. Ord and I are of one mind in this: what is done cannot be undone. My children should not seek war, but they would excel at it should it come to them.\n\nThey would be strong, like the elementals. But theirs would be a strength of spirit. They would never relent, never give up. Always seeking, always striving. Like life itself.\n\nThey should love the forest and green things, like the children of Val. But they should be at home in the cities the terrans and elementals build. In this world of chaos and law, they should seek balance. Not quick to anger. But once angered? A wildfire.\n\nIf they excel at war, the terrans will be jealous. They will be in constant conflict with each other.\n\nPerhaps. Yes, I think you’re right. It seems to be the great tragedy of our creation, war. But the constant threat of it will bring wisdom. It will take great wisdom to avoid such conflict, and those possessed of such wisdom will become great leaders.\n\nWould they be lorewise and crafty?\n\nOh, I would leave that to them. It is not meet that children should be too closely molded by their parents. But you ask, and my mind goes to Ket. They should lack the pride of Ket’s children…\n\nLook where that got him.\n\nHush, you. We should not be too hard on our Brother In Mourning. He has paid for his hubris. My children would love the world more than lore. That is my answer.\n\nThey seem a fine people, if you ask me.\n\nAnd there they are, look at them! Kul, your thoughts made real! Only in the world a little while, and already growing, learning.\n\nAh! My children! So fierce and unyielding. I see you lead short lives, like the terrans. Perhaps this is good.\n\nI see they get along well with Ord’s children. I think this a good sign.\n\nAlready they make homes in the forests by the elves. Some little skirmishing over borders, I note. Nothing serious.\n\nWhat shall you call them?\n\nOh, I do not care for such things. They should be free of our designs, like the terrans. Let them name themselves.\n\nOh! They already have! Kanin. It means “the people” in their tongue. I like that. Very democratic. Good for them.\n\nAnd will they know you?\n\nIf they wish. Much as I agreed with…the Father of Men…I find worship unseemly.\n\nAgreed.\n\nAgreed!\n\nLet me introduce myself, at least.\n\nAhem.\n\n“Hear me, kanin! This world we made is yours, as much as it is anyone’s. You belong here.\n\n“Know that you are my children, the children of Kul, he who put fire within the world. And there is fire in you.

      "ON POLDERS": "The three peasants—Jago, his wife Sarah, and his sister Beth—sat together watching the three heroes talk in the crowded common room of the inn. Well, Jackson Bootblack seemed to be doing most of the talking.\n\n“This kind of shit doesn’t work if it’s just a bunch of ratcatchers like us,” the polder said. “You need the people to rise up. Been fifteen years since Omund died—fifteen years of fighting wolves and bandits and worse. The people welcome a tyrant after that. They like order, you know? They adapt.”\n\n“If you stand on the grass long enough, it learns to lie flat,” A Mist Coils Around Dying Embers said. “But what do you say?”\n\n“Eh?” the polder asked her. But he glanced at Sir John staring at him.\n\n“You say the people have no stomach for rebellion,” Embers said. “But what about you?”\n\n“Oh,” the polder said, “I say it doesn’t matter much what I say. Why’s he looking at me like that?” the polder asked the high elf and pointed at Sir John. Realizing he was being rude, John shook his head to clear it. “Sorry, I just … I never met a polder before,” he said.\n\n“Are you kidding me?” Jackson said.\n\n“No! Sorry, I just …”\n\n“What are you, from the moon? Where you from that you never met a polder before? There’s polder in every fucking village and town from here to the sea.”\n\n“Really? That’s weird. I’m from Tor, I’ve been all over—just never met a polder before.”\n\nJackson looked at his friend, the high elf void mage. “Am I crazy?”\n\n“You’re not crazy,” Embers smiled. She was enjoying watching two of her friends get to know each other.\n\n“John’s just never run into one, it seems.”\n\n“Well, we’re adorable,” the polder said, and drank some ale.\n\n“They must have been around I guess,” John said. “I probably just never noticed.”\n\nThe polder put his drink down. “Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. You know, it’s funny. I never have any problem noticing you big assholes. One of you makes about as much noise as a cow, which … I don’t even know how you manage that.”\n\n“You’re talking just … my voice is just as loud as yours!”\n\n“I mean the way you walk around. Just the way you move, the way you stand up and sit down. You make so much goddamn noise.”\n\nJago, Sarah, and Beth all smiled at the exchange.\n\n“Humans are loud, yes,” Embers agreed.\n\n“Do we have to … can we talk about something else, please?”\n\n“I just …” The polder wouldn’t let it go. “You seriously never … you never been to an inn? Cavall’s teeth, I can’t count how many inns and taverns I’ve been to run by polders, got polders in the kitchen or waiting tables. One of the only two things we’re good at, I think.”\n\n“Yeah?” John asked. “What’s the other one?”\n\nThe little man smiled. “Getting into places we ain’t supposed to be.”\n\n“Now we’re talking,” Sir John said. “You were saying we need the people behind us. I agree.”\n\n“Yeah, okay. To business: How to rally the people.” The polder took the question seriously. “It’s not hard. First, we need someone they’ll rally around. I could make someone up, invent a local folk hero, but if we can find the real thing? They just need to look the part, that’s all. I’ll take care of the rest.”\n\n“I’m working on that,” John said. “But it’s … slower going than I thought. I’m betting on a long shot.”\n\n“What’s the holdup?”\n\nJohn thought about how to put what he knew into words. “You know,” he shrugged. “Some people can only be heroes if they think they’re above everyone else. Some people can only be heroes once they realize they’re not. And some people …”\n\nHe looked at his drink, at the expensive clear glass the innkeep had given him because he recognized Sir John. He turned the glass slowly on the table and now he was mostly talking to himself. “Some people still have to figure that out.”\n\n“Which is best?” Jackson asked, and Embers could tell the little man was testing John.\n\nJohn took a deep breath and came back to reality. “Well. If we could be picky, we wouldn’t need a hero,” he said.\n\nThe polder looked at the high elf and nodded, impressed. Test passed.\n\n“Okay. Well, if you’ve already got a candidate, I could get things started. The other half is: we need a good story—short, punchy. Something that’ll catch on, needs to be easy to relate to, but bigger than life. A tax. A toll! Bridge toll, classic. An ogre … no, three ogres. Yeah, three is better. Three ogres in Ajax’s livery. A lone figure standing against them. See? Easy.”\n\n“Where are we going to find three ogres?” John asked.\n\n“What do you mean?” Now it was the polder’s turn to be confused.\n\n“What do you mean, ‘What do I mean?’” John said.\n\n“I’m not … we don’t need real ogres.” Jackson looked at the elf. “Is he for real?”\n\n“Trust me,” the void mage said.\n\n“You mean you’re going to make it up?!” John exclaimed.\n\n“I…” Jackson looked with incredulity at the high elf void mage, then back at the human. “Yes, I do mean that. Does he know what I do?” he asked the elf.\n\n“He’ll learn,” Embers smiled.\n\nThe polder turned back to Sir John. “Hello. I lie for a living. And I’m really good at it. Sometimes also kill people, but only if lying or running away doesn’t work.”\n\nJohn turned to Embers. “I thought he was a thief.”\n\n“I was a thief,” the polder said.\n\n“You were a thief.”\n\n“Yeah, I was with the Clock. Probably still am—they don’t exactly let you just walk away. We sort of have an agreement. I agree to do what they tell me and they agree not to tell me to do anything.”\n\n“Did they kick you out, or did you quit?”\n\n“Depends on who you ask. I don’t like being told what to do. It’s sort of a polder thing. Hereditary or ancestral or whatever. Everybody wants a polder chef until they start trying to tell us what to cook.”\n\n“So what are you now?”\n\n“I’m annoying.”\n\nThe elf smiled. “He’s a troubadour—one of the best.”\n\nSir John looked at him, nodded. “No lute, I notice. And you don’t seem the type to sit by the hearth telling stories.”\n\nThe polder grinned. “I ain’t that kind of troubadour. I’m the other kind. I think the best story is the one people tell each other.”\n\n“Propaganda,” Sir John said, a grin spreading across his face. The polder pointed a finger at him and smiled. John heard the door to the inn open behind him. This wasn’t notable, but the gasp from the customers was.\n\n“Hey,” the polder said, looking past John to the doorway. “Hey, I think our folk hero just showed up. Damn, he looks the part all right. Or she, I can never tell with these guys.”\n\nJohn turned to see. Sir Vaantikalisax loomed just inside the doorway, his scales and armor glowing in the light of the hearth fire. Sir John shot up out of his chair, a huge smile on his face.\n\n“I, uh …” Vaantikalisax said. The tall, broad draconian looked from John to the three peasants. Jago, Sarah, and Beth were beaming with even more joy than John, if that were possible.\n\nThe knight stared at them for a moment, then turned back to his friend.\n\n“Maybe you’re right,” the dragon knight said.",

      "ON REVENANTS": "“I’m telling you, we are being followed.”\n\n“No one knows we’re here. No one even knows this place exists! We got all day. We stash everything here, and take a sample to …” The head thief pulled a vial out of a crate stuffed with straw and looked at it.\n\n“It’s just …” The junior cutpurse spoke nervously. “There was this lady knight in Blackbottom sniffing around. She seemed serious. I got this weird … chill when I looked at her.”\n\n“Hey,” the head thief said, his brow furrowed as he looked at the label on the vial. “Where’d you say you bought this stuff? You said a ship—a ship from where?”\n\n“I dunno, uh … uh, Capital I think.”\n\nThe head thief looked at the panicking cutpurse. “This lady knight—she have a red and blue device on her shield?”\n\n“Black gods,” one of the other thieves said. “It can’t be Lady Filliamo, can it?”\n\nThere was a firm knock at the door to the safe house. A door which, from the outside, looked like an unremarkable section of wall.\n\n“Oh, you’ve got to be kidding me.”\n\n“Nonono! How could she … Capital was nine months ago!”\n\n“She’s a revenant, idiot! She doesn’t even need air. She could have walked here! Just … into the water and across the bottom of the sea! Black gods, why didn’t you say anything?”\n\n“I did! You asshole, I just did! I been trying to tell you for—”\n\n“Man, there is a difference between, ‘Hey I think we’re being shadowed,’ and, ‘There’s a deathless copper coming after us!’”\n\nOne of the four thieves opened a vial and dipped his dirk into the red oil within.\n\n“What is that gonna do? She’s already dead!”\n\nAnother knock at the hidden door. “Forget it. Let her knock. Grab as many as you can, and we’ll go out the back.”\n\nThe head thief ran for the door out the back of the safe house. He jerked it open—and the other thieves watched as a silver flash silently flared across his forehead.\n\nThrough the open door, they could see the silhouette of the knight, her open hand held up in front of her.\n\nShe clenched her hand into a fist and the judgment she had placed on the head cutpurse detonated, hurling him backward. He sprawled across the floor, conscious but stunned.\n\nThe gray-skinned knight walked into the room. Metal heels rang out on the wooden floor. She seemed relaxed, but her eyes burned with inner fire.\n\n“Boys,” Lady Filliamo said pleasantly. “Busy morning.”\n\n“How did you … this is impossible, how did you find us?”\n\nShe looked at the man groaning on the floor. “Your boss didn’t tell you about the vengeance mark?”\n\n“You marked us. Back in Capital. You marked one of us and just … just walked here.”\n\n“Don’t be stupid. I marked you in Blackbottom. Capital was just normal detective work. I came here by ship.” She smiled—black lips on pale gray skin.\n\n“Come on.” The braver of the three remaining thieves drew twin daggers. “She can’t get all of us at—”\n\nLady Filliamo made a broad gesture with her right hand and argent marks flared across the foreheads of all three thieves. A clatter of weapons hitting the floor. Three pairs of hands slowly rose in the air.\n\n“Good boys. Here, put these on.” She tossed three pairs of manacles on the floor.\n\n“Hang on, you can’t arrest us,” one of the thieves, unarmed and still holding his hands up, said. “This isn’t Capital. You don’t have jurisdiction!”\n\nLady Filliamo shrugged. “I’m a knight of the church. Jurisdiction’s for the city watch.” She drew her silver sword a few inches from the scabbard just to show them the blade.\n\n“I deal in steel.”",

    "TIME RAIDER": {
      "ON TIME RAIDERS": "“You will tell me the location of the ship you came here in.”\n\nTaxiarch Lycaon paced outside the ruined church. The four-armed woman with crystal eyes and flaming pink hair in a strip down the center of her shaved head sneered at him. She was chained to the ruin of a stone column outside the ruin of a stone church.\n\n“Is it that your brain is so small you must talk in order to think?” The woman’s smile was a sneer.\n\nLycaon strode toward the alien, grabbed a length of chain around her waist, and yanked on it, pulling it taut so the chain around her neck tightened. “You are going to die in any event,” he said. “If you wish to deny me the pleasure of hearing you howl and scream for mercy, tell me what I want to know now and my dogs will kill you quickly.”\n\nUp close she could see the fine stitching along Lycaon’s cheeks and forehead, the very slight differences in skin tone that showed his skin was not his own.\n\n“You seem to be made of bits,” the alien said as she peered at Lycaon, her crystalline eyes catching and reflecting prismatic light. “And not the best bits. Leftovers? Is that what you are? A walking assemblage of cast-off scraps? Hahah, I thought the proteans were hideous. Someone should let them know! There are creatures even more foul-seeming and useless in the timescape.”\n\nThe Taxiarch smiled to himself, nodded with respect at the woman’s epithets. He placed his foot on a low piece of rubble, once part of the wall of the stone church, and leaned his arm on his knee. He was not dressed as the other war dogs. No black leather for him. He wore a gold breastplate with the embossed head of a ram molded into it, a white cape over his back. Gold greaves and red leather boots and gloves. The other war dogs only had patches of hair but his was long and blonde.\n\nHe struck a casual, jaunty pose. “Where is your worldship?” he said in a more reasonable voice. “Or came you here in a single-seater starskimmer?” At this, the alien’s crystal eyes went wide, betraying surprise.\n\n“You see?” The Taxiarch said, impressed with himself. “I am not a primitive like these peasants, who hounded you because you are alien,” he nodded at the folk of the small town watching from the stables some distance away. “I am Ajax’s elite. Better than his chosen. I was made for victory.”\n\nIndeed, Taxiarch Lycaon looked almost fully human. Handsome and fit like a statue from Phaedros, which his model had almost certainly been inspired by. Unless you looked closely, there was no sign he was a product of the body banks. “If you agree to lead me to your vessel, I will let you go free.”\n\nThe alien sighed. “‘Blaap blaap blaap,’” she said. “You should hear yourself. Like barking thrazz, you sound to me. Who holds your leash I wonder? For surely a microbrain such as you could not command any more than these rabble,” she nodded her head at the other twenty or so war dogs.\n\nHer taunts worked. Lycaon hauled back and punched the alien in the jaw. Her head smashed into the ruined column. She was dazed but she shook it off and laughed.\n\n“Look how easily this one is goaded!” she said. She spat out dark blue blood and turned to the peasants gathered. “You people! Why do you let yourselves be cowed by these … bits? Bits of people kludged together? Even the least of you is worth more than these.”\n\n“Perhaps from the air,” Flight Captain Lyria offered, and she stroked the feathers of her giant hawk mount to calm it. “I could scout the forest around the …”\n\n“No!” Taxiarch Lycaon pointed a finger at the hawklord and strode toward her. “You are the elite of Ajax’s winged harriers, I am his chosen brigade commander. We are not scavengers! This one,” he stabbed a gloved finger at the alien, “will come to heel, or I will give her to my war dogs.” He turned to face the chained alien, who yawned. Lycaon seethed.\n\n“They may pull you apart,” he said to her, and at this, his squadron of soldiers, all in black leather and golden pauldrons, started making barking sounds. Then they laughed at each other.\n\n“Or I may let my crucibite melt the skin from your bones.”\n\nAt that, a war dog clad in leather from head to foot wearing a heavy mask with glass circles where the eyes should be and some kind of canister over his mouth stepped forward. The long thin brass tube in his hands connected to a large metal tank on his back.\n\n“Shall I let you choose?” the Taxiarch said and drew a dagger from his belt. “I will cut off one finger. If you cry out, I kill you. If not, another finger. And if you cry out then…”\n\nSlowly everyone assembled could make out the sounds of a conversation, quiet with a metallic ring to it. The voices got louder until eventually they could be heard.\n\n“…should be ready for anything,” one voice said, deep, commanding, and images started to form around and between the war dogs, the hawklord, and the Taxiarch. Like faded images in a manuscript they seemed, gaining pigment and clarity and, eventually, depth as their voices grew louder and clearer.\n\n“Oh, thank you for the brilliant tactical advice,” another voice, high pitched, piped up.\n\nSuddenly, the images became three dimensional, solid, and four heroes stood among them. A human in working battle plate. A polder with twin rapiers in his hands. A tall willowy high elf with night-black skin and golden hair. And a Dragon Knight. The people of the town gasped when they saw him. Even at a distance, even with the war dogs between them, they recognized the device of Good King Omund on the knight’s shield.\n\nThe war dogs scrambled. For a moment, it seemed they might flee at this sudden intrusion, but the Taxiarch bellowed “Hold fast!” and they held their ground, uncertainty over the unknown threat of a band of heroes battling in each of them with the certain fear of their commander.\n\nJohn immediately read the situation. It was a clear enough picture.\n\nThere was something about the war dogs. They loved Ajax’s cruelty—reveled in it. John had crossed swords with other commanders in Ajax’s army before. Ground Commander Vordokov was a professional—could be reasoned with, but he was an orc.\n\nNot the war dogs—they were fanatics.\n\n“What’s this?” the Taxiarch called out with a hungry grin. “Allies of the alien?” He was projecting confidence. Trying to muster his wary soldiers.\n\nSir John ignored the war dog, tilted his head toward the alien. “Embers?”\n\n“A kuran’zoi,” the high elf said, and the alien held her head up with pride. “A time raider from the upper worlds. What the truth is I cannot say, and no people are all one thing. But by reputation? They’re intractable, ungovernable, they loathe authority, hate tyranny and are totally, utterly without fear.”\n\nJohn watched the alien. They sneered their approval at Ember’s summary. That was enough for Sir John, they could work out the details later. After everything they’d been through before, he trusted Embers implicitly.\n\nHe could see the shape of the next moments play out, all he had to do was take the initiative. If he was right, the whole thing would be over in seconds. There was no time to communicate. No time to plan, and everyone, everyone had to play their part.\n\nJohn knew what came next, but he wasn’t an assassin. He had his own part to play. He took a step forward, away from his teammates, and noted the Taxiarch didn’t react. This spoke volumes. He locked eyes with his enemy.\n\n“She goes free,” John commanded, his voice steel, “or you die here.” He could feel the muscles tightening in his comrades, the whole company like a steel spring wound tight.\n\nLycaon cocked his head at Sir John and took a few foolish steps toward the tactician. He was just out of reach. But close enough.\n\n“I see you are a man, like Ajax. Why do you lower yourself with these … creatures?” the war dog Taxiarch looked at the elf, polder, and dragon knight. “Little more than slimy things crawled out of the sea? Join us. Join me. Join Ajax. It’ll be nice for you,” his voice lowered almost to a whisper, “to be on the winning side for a change.”\n\nSir John took a deep breath, his body language changed and that was enough. Several things then happened at once, so quickly no one would later be able to say who acted first.\n\nEmber’s eyes flashed into a starfield. The time raider’s chains dissolved into starspace and reappeared around Flight Captain Lyria pinning her arms to her side. She was giving the hawklord an excuse to sit this one out. Gods, John was glad she was with them.\n\nThe time raider’s right upper hand shot out, as though she’d been waiting for the void mage to do exactly what she just did, and her meson blaster leapt out of the hands of the war dog who’d chained her. The pistol made of glass and bronze slammed into her hand and its tip flared with prismatic light.\n\nFrom the sun’s shadow cast by Taxiarch Lycaon, the polder Jackson Bootblack emerged, a rapier in each hand, and no one had seen him move from where he’d been a moment before.\n\nAt the same instant, a call—a horn. From directly behind John a blast of sound like a chord played by a dozen trumpets, and hope sang in John’s heart—the Clarion Call of the last Storm Knight!\n\nJohn hadn’t hesitated, he’d already drawn his sword.\n\n“All right, you patchwork son of a bitch.” He charged Lycaon, who fumbled with the short-sword on his belt.\n\n***“Draw steel!”***",

  "CULTURE": {
    "CREATING A CULTURE": {
      "USING CULTURE": "Directors can use the rules in this section to build cultures that players can choose for their characters. Players can use these rules to build a unique culture or modify an existing culture for their character, working with the Director to find a right place for that culture within the world of the campaign’s world. The Vasloria Cultures table provides a cultural breakdown for Vasloria, the game’s medieval European fantasy analog.\n\n['(Playtest note: That table is still to come.)']\n\nYou can use the table for a campaign that takes place in Vasloria, or pillage from it liberally for a custom setting.\n\nIn many worlds, at least some cultures have a majority ancestry. The people of Bedegar, a duchy in Vasloria, are mostly humans. The folk dwelling in the Great Wode, a forest realm north of Bedegar, are primarily wode elves. However, you can always choose to be from one of these cultures and take a different ancestry. A dwarf raised in the culture of the Great Wode speaks Yllyric and probably knows a lot about nature, while a dwarf raised in the dwarven thanedom of Kal Kalavar speaks Zaliac and might know a good deal about smithing.",
      "WHY BUILD A CULTURE?": "Building a character is about more than adding up your stats, picking skills and abilities, and recording that information on a character sheet. You’re building a hero—a main character in a story, be it a one-shot or a heroic campaign. Think about the personality and the past of who you are creating. That’s why the game lets you build a culture rather than simply saying, “Pick three skills and a bonus language.” We want players to imagine their heroes as complex and intricate characters."
    },
    "CULTURE BENEFITS": {
      "LANGUAGE": "Your culture’s language aspect determines how the people of your culture communicate. This can be any language in Languages.",
      "ENVIRONMENT": "Your culture’s environment aspect describes where the people of that culture spend most of their time. Is your culture centered in a bustling city or a small village? Did you spend your early life in an isolated monastery? Or did you wander the wilderness, never staying in one place for long?\n\nWhen you build a culture, select its environment aspect from the following options: nomadic, rural, secluded, urban, or wilderness. You then gain skill options from your chosen environment. All of these environments can be found in any sort of terrain, whether aboveground, in subterranean caverns, deep in trackless forest, or even underwater.\n\nNOMADIC\n\nA nomadic culture travels from place to place to survive. They might follow animal migrations or the weather, travel to sell their wares or services, or simply enjoy a restless lifestyle full of new experiences and peoples. Those who grow up in nomadic cultures learn to navigate the wilderness and interact with others.\n\n**Skill Options:** One skill from the exploration or interpersonal skill groups.\n\nRURAL\n\nA rural culture is one located in a town, village, or smaller settled enclave. People dwelling in such places often cultivate the land, trade goods or services with travelers passing through, harvest fish from the sea, or mine metals and gems from the earth.\n\nLiving among a small population, most folks in a rural community learn a trade and are handed down bits of essential knowledge to help their community survive. For example, when a rural culture has only one blacksmith, it’s important to have an apprentice already learning at the anvil well before that smith starts to get old. If the only priest in town gets the sniffles, folks want an acolyte ready to wear the fancy robes should the worst occur.\n\n**Skill Options:** One skill from the crafting or lore skill groups.\n\nSECLUDED\n\nA secluded culture is based in one relatively close-quarters structure—a building, a cavern, and so forth—and interacts with other cultures only rarely. Such places are often buildings or complexes such as monasteries, castles, or prisons. Folk in a secluded culture have little or no reason to leave their home or interact with other cultures on the outside, but might have an awareness of those cultures and of events happening outside their enclave.\n\nWhen people live together in close quarters, they typically learn to get along. They often spend much time in study or introspection, as there is not much else to do in seclusion.\n\n**Skill Options:** One skill from the interpersonal or lore skill groups.\n\nURBAN\n\nAn urban culture is always centered in a city. Such a culture might arise within the walls of Capital, a massive metropolis with a cosmopolitan population; within a network of caverns that hold an underground city; or in any other place where a large population lives relatively close together. The people of urban cultures often learn to effectively misdirect others in order to navigate the crowds and the political machinations that can come with city life.\n\n**Skill Options:** One skill from the interpersonal or intrigue skill groups.\n\nWILDERNESS\n\nA wilderness culture doesn’t attempt to tame the terrain in which its people live, whether desert, forest, swamp, tundra, ocean, or more exotic climes. Instead, the folk of such a culture thrive amid nature, taking their sustenance and shelter from the land itself. A wilderness culture might be a circle of druids protecting a great wode, a band of brigands hiding out in desert caves, or a camp of orc mercenaries who call the trackless mountains home. People in a wilderness culture learn how to use the land for all they need to live, typically crafting their own tools, clothing, and more.\n\n**Skill Options:** One skill from the crafting or exploration skill groups.",
      "ORGANIZATION": {
        "ANARCHIC": "In an anarchic culture, there are no rules and no one person leads the others. This might sound like complete chaos—people taking what they want when they want it—and some cultures that practice anarchy are. Other anarchic cultures are peaceful places where people mostly work for themselves, their friends, or their family, but rely on the whole group when times get tough.\n\nMany anarchic cultures come together when the need arises, but they leave day-to-day responsibilities up to the individual. If an informal leader appears, it’s because each member of the culture has decided to follow that person for a time, and the leader enjoys their power only as long as they keep everyone happy. A group of rangers who protect a vast forest, a gang of rebels fighting against a tyrannical despot leader, and a bandit group roving the wilds without a leader are all anarchic cultures.\n\nMost anarchic cultures operate outside of settled lands, sticking to the wilds, city sewers, or other secret places. For even when such cultures are harmless, their members know that outsiders might try to impose rules upon them if they live in the same place. As such, many folks in anarchic cultures learn how to navigate the wilds and fend for themselves while avoiding the danger that other folks can represent.\n\n**Skill Options:** One skill from the exploration or intrigue skill groups.",
        "BUREAUCRATIC": "Bureaucratic cultures are steeped in official leadership and formally recorded laws. Members of such a culture are often ranked in power according to those laws, with a small group of people holding the power to rule according to birthright, popular vote, or some other official and measurable standard. Many bureaucratic communities have one person at the very top, though others might be ruled by a council. A trade guild with a guildmaster, treasurer, secretary, and a charter of rules and regulations for membership; a feudal lord who rules over a group of knights, who in turn rule over peasants who work the land; and a militaristic society with ranks and rules that its people must abide are all examples of bureaucratic cultures.\n\nThose who thrive in bureaucratic cultures don’t just follow the rules. They know how to use those rules to their advantage, either bending, changing, or reinterpreting policy to advance their own interests. Schmoozing with those who make the laws is often key to this approach. Others in a bureaucratic culture might specialize in operating outside the strict regulations that govern the culture without getting caught.\n\n**Skill Options:** One skill from the intrigue or lore skill groups.",
        "COMMUNAL": "A communal culture has no formal book of laws or rules for governing. Instead, the community works together to pick leaders and make important decisions. Often in these cultures, each person has a relatively equal say in how the culture operates, and everyone contributes to help the culture survive and thrive. People share the burdens of governing, physical labor, childcare, and other duties. A collective of farmers who work together to cultivate and protect their land without a noble, a city of pirates where each person can do as they wish, and a traveling theatrical troupe whose members vote on every artistic and administrative decision are all communal cultures.\n\nSome communal cultures have one or more people who serve as leaders, but the way these leaders come to power is never official. Some are thrust into the role by people who admire their stances and actions. Other leaders seize power without the help of an official process, dethroning a previous leader and claiming their power without a challenge. People in communal cultures learn that their voice and individuality has worth, as do the opinions and hard work of others.\n\n**Skill Options**: One skill from the crafting or interpersonal skill groups."

      "UPBRINGING": {
        "ACADEMIC": "Heroes with an academic upbringing were raised by people who collect, study, and share books and other records. Some academics focus on one area of study, such as a college for wizards dedicated to the study of magic, or a church that teaches the word of one deity. People in an academic culture learn how to wield the power that is knowledge.\n\n**Skill Options**: One skill from the lore skill group.",
        "CREATIVE": "Heroes with a creative upbringing were raised among folk who create art or other works valuable enough to trade. A creative culture might produce fine art such as dance, music, or sculpture, or more practical wares such as wagons, weapons, tools, or buildings. People in such cultures learn the value of quality crafting and attention to detail.\n\n**Skill Options**: The Music or Perform skill, or one skill from the crafting skill group.",
        "ILLEGAL": "Heroes with an illegal upbringing had caregivers who performed activities that other folk—whether within or outside their culture—considered unlawful. A band of pirates, a guild of assassins, or an organization of spies all commit unlawful acts for money. People with illegal upbringings typically don’t mind breaking the rules when it suits them—and are good at making sure no one finds out they did.\n\n**Skill Options**: One skill from the intrigue skill group.",
        "LABOR": "People who labor for a living survive through cultivation, typically raising crops or livestock on a farm; by harvesting natural resources, whether by hunting, trapping, logging, or mining; or through manual labor tied to settlement and trade, such as construction, carting, loading cargo, and so forth. People with a labor upbringing know the value of hard work.\n\n**Skill Options**: One of the Blacksmithing or Handle Animals skills, or one skill from the exploration skill group.",
        "MARTIAL": "Heroes who have a martial upbringing are raised by warriors. These might be the soldiers of an established army, a band of mercenaries, a guild of monster-slaying adventurers, or any other folk whose lives revolve around combat. Heroes with a martial upbringing are always ready for a fight—and they know how to finish that fight.\n\n**Skill Options**: One of the Alertness, Blacksmithing, Climb, Endurance, Fletching, Intimidate, Jump, Monsters, Ride, or Track skills.",
        "NOBLE": "Heroes with a noble upbringing were raised by leaders who rule over others and play the games of politics to maintain power. Many families are nobles by birthright, but some cultures have noble titles that are earned through deeds or popularity. Whatever the case, heroes with this background understand why the whispered words in the right ear can sometimes be more powerful than any army.\n\n**Skill Options**: One skill from the interpersonal skill group.",
        "BUT I REALLY WANT ALERTNESS": "['If the culture you create doesn’t grant a skill that you want, check with your Director about modifying what the culture’s aspects offer. For instance, you can easily make the case that a culture with the martial upbringing aspect should give a character access to the Alertness skill, given that being successful in battle means always being aware of your surroundings.']"

It might be something deeper and more abstract, as with a chance for happiness or a lifetime goal snatched away.\n\nIt might be the case that you’re obsessed with getting back what you lost. You might be in a position where you’ll never recover what was taken from you, but you want to prevent that same loss from happening to others. It might be a little bit of both.

While working on this commission, you and the hero became close friends. The day you finished the work was the same day they disappeared. To honor their legacy, you took up the mantle of a hero with the intent of finishing your friend's work. |\n| 2   | **Inspired**: As you traveled the road selling your wares, troll bandits attacked you. One of the bandits claimed an item belonging to someone precious to you—or perhaps claimed that person’s life—but the rest were driven off or slain by a group of heroes. Seeing the quick work these heroes made of the bandits inspired you to follow in their footsteps.                                |\n| 3   | **Robbery**: A criminal gang stole your goods and harmed a number of people who worked for you. You became a hero to prevent such indignities from being visited upon others, to seek revenge for the assault, or to find the thieves and get your stuff back.                                                                                                                                    |"

In order to make up for the loss you caused, you left your criminal ways behind and became a hero.                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| 2   | **Friendly Priest**: You went to prison for your crimes and eventually escaped. An elderly priest took you in and shielded you from the law, convinced that your soul wasn’t corrupt. They never judged you for your past, speaking only of the future. Eventually, the priest died, imparting final words that inspired you to become a hero.                                                                          |\n| 3   | **Stand Against Tyranny**: When a tyrant rose to power in your homeland, they began cracking down on all criminals with deadly raids and public executions. The nature of the crime didn’t matter—pickpockets and beggars were made to kneel before the axe alongside murderers. After losing enough friends, you stood up and joined the resistance—not just against this tyrant, but against authoritarians anywhere. |"

You held up your end of the deal—which made the knife in your back after the loss so surprising. You woke in a shallow grave, barely alive, and ready to mete out justice.                                                                            |\n| 2   | **Heckler**: As you stood victorious on the arena sands, a voice cried out among the cheering. “This violence is just for show. You should be ashamed. There are people who need you—who need your skills!” Why did that voice ring so clear? And why did it sound so familiar? You never saw the face of the person who uttered the words, but they weighed heavy on you.

Earth abilities create and shape physical terrain in a permanent way, and bolster the strength and hardiness of allies.', '**Fire** is the element of destruction. Fire abilities harm enemies and objects.', '**Green** is the element of creation and growth. Green abilities make and manipulate plants, fungi, and other forms of life to hamper foes and nourish your allies.', '**Rot** is the element of death. Rot abilities decay and debuff enemies.', '**Void** is the element of the unknown. Void abilities warp space and reality, allowing you to teleport, create illusions, and make things incorporeal.', '**Water** is the element of change. Water abilities enhance what your allies can do, and alter the abilities of your enemies for the worse.']\n\nHeroic abilities that include your specialization’s keyword have their initial essence cost reduced by 1 (to a minimum of 1). This reduced cost doesn’t apply to abilities you gain because of your specialization, such as Manipulate Earth or Void Sight.\n\nChoose one of the following elements to be your specialty: earth, fire, green, or void.

If you lose some or all of this essence outside of combat, it takes you 1 minute to regain it. You can also dedicate that essence to maintaining persistent abilities (see Persistent Magic below).\n\nWhen combat begins, you keep any essence you had outside of combat. At the start of each of your turns during combat, you gain 2 essence. When combat ends, you once more have essence equal to your Victories.",

If you maintain a persistent ability in combat, you reduce the amount of essence you earn at the start of your turn by an amount equal to the ability’s persistent value, which enables the ability’s persistent effect. All your active persistent abilities end when combat ends.\n\nYou can maintain a persistent ability outside of combat as long as you have Victories equal to or greater than its persistent value. If you maintain a persistent ability outside of combat, the maximum essence you can use on other abilities is reduced by the ability’s persistent value. For instance, if you have 4 Victories and maintain the Stone Ward ability (a persistent ability with a cost of 1 essence), you can only use abilities costing 3 essence or less outside of combat.\n\nYou can’t maintain any abilities that would make you earn a negative amount of essence at the start of your turn or have a negative amount of essence outside of combat. You can stop maintaining an ability at any time (no action required).\n\nIf you maintain the same ability on several targets and the effect includes a power roll, you make that roll once and apply the same effect to all targets. A creature can’t be affected by multiple instances of a persistent ability.\n\nWhenever you take damage while you have an active persistent ability, you must make the following power roll.\n\n**Power Roll + Reason**:\n\n['11 or lower: You lose all active persistent abilities.', '12–16: If you have only one persistent ability active, it remains active. Otherwise, you lose one active persistent ability of your choice.', '17+: All your active persistent abilities remain active.']",

Its graduates use Black Ash sorcery to teleport around the battlefield in clouds of soot, and to manipulate and create darkness. Graduates of the college are unmatched in mobility. You gain the Magic skill.', '**College of Caustic Alchemy:** The College of Caustic Alchemy teaches its students recipes for the acids, bombs, and poisons used in their grim work. Graduates of the college are exceptional assassins. You gain the Alchemy skill.', '**College of the Harlequin Mask:** Graduates of the College of the Harlequin Mask learn illusion magic, which they use to infiltrate enemy strongholds and create orchestrated chaos in combat.

You can still swing a Blade of Quintessence around, but you don’t get any of its bonuses or benefits.\n\nIf you find a piece of equipment you really want to use that isn’t part of your kit, you can always change your kit as a respite activity."

The benefit and drawback of a complication makes your connection to the game deeper and more interesting, and provides hooks to let the Director better draw your hero into the campaign’s story.\n\nNot all complication benefits and drawbacks are created equal, but each benefit is balanced by its drawback. If you have a powerful positive side to your complication, be prepared to have an equally influential bit of negative backstory as well.",
    "MODIFYING THE STORY": "You can modify the narrative of a complication to better fit with your vision of your character’s backstory—or change it entirely. For instance, if you choose Devil Deal as a complication, you can have your hero instead make that deal with an archfey or an undead general!\n\nMany of the details of each complication are purposefully left vague, so that you can connect it to the rest of your backstory. If your complication took place during “an attack” or “an accident,” you decide the specific details of who or what attacked you, or what type of accident befell you.",

      "CULT VICTIM": "Cultists captured you while raiding your home, then began an unholy ritual to turn your body into an undead spirit. The ritual failed, but your body became infused with corrupted magic, turning you partially incorporeal.\n\n**Benefit**: Once per turn, you can move through a solid mundane object no more than 1 square thick. If you end your turn inside the object, you take 5 damage and are shunted out into the space where you entered the object.\n\n**Drawback**: Your body is more susceptible to negative energy. You have corruption weakness 5.",
      "DEVIL DEAL": "Your ancestors made a deal with an archdevil that has tied you to that fiend’s service. When you first learned of this deal, you were taken to the Seven Cities of Hell, where some of the timescape’s best minds taught you the ways of battle or magic. The archdevil allows you to use these gifts as you will … until they require a favor from you.\n\n**Benefit**: Whenever you are present for a battle in which all the creatures on one side are not surprised, your side goes first on a result of 4 or greater on the d10 roll (see Determine Who Goes First in Combat Round).\n\n**Drawback**: The archdevil occasionally asks you to defeat enemies on their behalf. If you refuse, your fiendish patron sends devils after you and those you care about.",
      "ELEMENTAL ABSORPTION": "When an evil mage threatened someone you loved, you blocked your foe’s summoning of an elemental creature by absorbing their magic with your body. You are now infused with the power of that elemental—and they’re not happy about it.\n\n**Benefit**: Your Stamina increases by 6 at 1st level, then increases by an additional 1 each time you gain a new level.\n\n**Drawback**: When you are dying, your possessing elemental takes control of your body. The elemental yearns for destruction, causing you to attack the closest creature they notice without regard for your desires or your body’s safety.",
      "FIRE AND CHAOS": "A great monster who breathed fire burned your home to the ground. While everything around you was consumed, you somehow stood strong amid the inferno, your body adapting to ignore the effects of the flames.\n\n**Benefit**: You have fire immunity 5.\n\n**Drawback**: You have cold weakness 5.",
      "PRIMORDIAL SICKNESS": "You once contracted a terrible illness for which no one could find a cure. You sought out a primordial swamp said to be either incredibly poisonous or miraculously salubrious. It turned out to be both, keeping your illness at bay while corrupting your body with its unnatural energy.\n\n**Benefit**: You have poison immunity 5 and corruption immunity 5.\n\n**Drawback**: The number of Recoveries you have is reduced by 1.",
      "PUNISHMENT CURSE": "Through ignorance, fear, spite, or selfishness, you refused to help someone in need. To teach you a lesson, a deity offered you what seemed to be a blessing—extra power to help you heal yourself in times of need, but harsh consequences should your need become excessive. You took the deal, and now benefit from the blessing but also suffer from a curse.\n\n**Benefit**: You have 2 additional Recoveries.\n\n**Drawback**: When you are out of Recoveries, you are dying, no matter what your current Stamina is.",
      "SHIPWRECKED": "You are the sole survivor of a shipwreck that left you stranded on a remote and inhospitable island for years. Your struggle to survive there granted you insight into the natural world but distanced you from who you once were.\n\n**Benefit**: You gain two skills from the exploration skill group.\n\n**Drawback**: You have forgotten one language you know.",
      "VIVID DREAMS": "You broke a magic amulet that immersed your mind in weird magic. This magic has given you the power of premonition, but you struggle to control this new gift. Whenever you take a respite, make a Reason power roll to determine whether you gain this complication’s benefit or drawback.\n\n**Benefit**: On a 12 to 16, you experience a vision of an event currently happening in your world. The vision lasts for just a few seconds, but the information you glean is helpful to you. On a 17 or higher, you receive a full minute or more of the scene.\n\n**Drawback**: On an 11 or lower, you receive a painful vision that is fractal and inscrutable.

    "WHEN TO MAKE A TEST": {
      "IT JUST WORKS!": "When a hero attempts to solve a task that normally requires a test with clever, outside-the-box thinking, the Director can instead decide that no test is required and the attempt automatically works! For example, if a hero who wants to climb a wall first covers their hands and feet in giant strands of sticky spider webs, the Director might decide that they can climb up the wall without needing to make a test.\n\nThat said, such clever ideas often work for free the first time, but the Director could decide they require tests if they are used again."
    },
    "HOW TO MAKE A TEST": {
      "CHARACTERISTICS AND TESTS": {
        "MIGHT TESTS": "You make a Might test whenever a risky task calls for the use of physical strength. Might tests are most often used for breaking down doors and other structures, hurling heavy objects, pulling your body up a sheer wall, swimming against a mighty current, and other feats of physical power.",
        "AGILITY TESTS": "You make an Agility test whenever a risky task calls for the use of your physical coordination and nimbleness. Agility tests are most often used for tumbling, sneaking, picking locks, and engaging in sleight of hand.",
        "REASON TESTS": "You make a Reason test whenever you attempt a risky task that requires the use of your mental acumen and education, formal or otherwise. Reason tests are most often used to recall lore, deduce information based on clues, complete a puzzle, forge counterfeit items or documents, break a code, convince others of a logical argument, or make an estimation.",
        "INTUITION TESTS": "You make an Intuition test whenever you attempt a risky task that requires the use of your powers of observation and instinct. Intuition tests are most often used to notice hidden creatures or details, discern another person’s motivations or honesty, calm and reassure others, and train animals.",
        "PRESENCE TESTS": "You make a Presence test whenever you attempt a risky task that requires the use of your force of personality. Presence tests are most often used to gain trust, project confidence, and influence and lead other creatures."
      },
      "INFLUENCING PLAYER CHARACTER ACTIONS WITH TESTS": "['Tests can’t be used by NPCs or PCs to influence the actions of PCs. Many players feel that their agency is taken away if they’re compelled to jump into a pile of gold filled with hidden scorpions because an NPC convinced them to do so with a Presence test. For most players, it’s not fun to be in control of a single hero and lose some of that control.', 'Instead, Directors should do their level best to have an NPC suggest that a character dive headlong into the gold like a billionaire duck, then let the player decide what their character does. Similarly, a Director might decide that one player character can’t make an Intuition test to discern another PC’s motivations or honesty.', 'That said, if everyone in your gaming group decides to lift one or more of these restrictions after talking about it, go for it! There’s no wrong way to play as long as everyone is having fun. The MCDM Safety Toolkit (available for download at [https://mcdm.gg/SafetyToolkit](https://mcdm.gg/SafetyToolkit)) discusses how to talk about potentially problematic topics such as limiting character agency at your table.']",
      "TEST DIFFICULTY": {
        "EASY TESTS": "An easy test has some risk of failure, but most heroes will likely overcome it. The power roll you make for an easy test determines the outcome (see Test Outcomes):\n\n['11 or lower: You fail the task.', '12–16: You succeed on the task.', '17+: You succeed on the task with a reward.']",
        "MEDIUM TESTS": "A medium test has some risk of failure that most heroes will likely overcome—but with a cost. The power roll you make for a medium test determines the outcome:\n\n['11 or lower: You fail the task and incur a consequence.', '12–16: You succeed on the task and incur a consequence.', '17+: You succeed on the task.']",
        "HARD TESTS": "A hard test has a greater risk of failure, and most heroes are likely to suffer some hardship while trying to overcome the intended task. The power roll you make for a hard test determines the outcome:\n\n['11 or lower: You fail the task and incur a consequence.', '12–16: You fail the task.', '17+: You succeed on the task.']",
        "NATURAL 19 OR 20: SUCCESS WITH A REWARD": "When you get a natural 19 or 20 on a test’s power roll, you succeed on the task with a reward, even if the test has a medium or hard difficulty."
      },
      "TEST OUTCOMES": {
        "FAILURE WITH A CONSEQUENCE": "If you fail a test and incur a consequence, you don’t do what you set out to do—in addition to which, you suffer an impactful setback. The Director determines the exact nature of the consequence, which is typically related to the specific task. For instance, if a hero suffers a consequence while trying to climb a wall, they might make it halfway up the wall and then fall, taking damage and landing prone. A hero trying to sneak by cultists might be spotted by those foes, who immediately attack. If a consequence strikes when a hero attempts to bribe a prison guard, the guard might decide to arrest the hero or lead them into a trap. If a hero suffers a consequence on a Reason test made to recall lore about the king’s favorite meal, they might confuse it for a dish to which the monarch is deathly allergic.\n\nNot all consequences need to be immediate or apparent. For example, a hero might fail with a consequence on a test made to cheat at a high-stakes game of cards with a noble. The failure means that the noble notices, but the Director decides that the noble doesn’t say anything. This consequence isn’t made apparent until later in the evening, when the noble has guards surround the hero and take the cheater down to the dungeon for stacking the deck.\n\nCommon consequences for failing a test include the following:\n\n['Making an NPC so upset that they storm off, or betray, attack, or otherwise attempt to harm you', 'Drawing the attention of a group of foes', 'Triggering a trap or hazard that captures or significantly harms you or an ally', 'Breaking an important piece of equipment that is difficult to replace or repair', 'Thinking you know something that you don’t', 'Getting stuck in a situation that must be resolved with a negotiation or a montage test that you didn’t need to make before']\n\nIn lieu of other consequences, the Director has the option to gain 2 additional Villain Power (VP), a resource their creatures use in combat, at the start of the next combat encounter.",
        "FAILURE": "If you fail a test without incurring a consequence, you simply don’t do what you set out to do. If you’re attempting to climb a wall, you find no purchase. If you’re attempting to recall lore, you can’t remember the desired facts. If you’re attempting to bribe a guard, they don’t take the bait.\n\nWhen you get this result, the Director can decide that there might still be a small penalty for failure, depending on the circumstances of the test. This penalty shouldn’t be as harsh as rolling a failure with a consequence, though. For instance, a hero who gets this result on an Agility test made to sneak by a group of cultists might draw the attention of one cultist with their failure. Now that cultist is coming to investigate, but they haven’t raised the alarm… yet.",
        "SUCCESS WITH A CONSEQUENCE": "If you succeed on a test and incur a consequence, you do what you set out to do, but with an added cost. You might succeed in climbing up a wall, but the surface of the wall crumbles and becomes unstable as you do, making the climb more difficult for the ally ascending after you. When trying to sneak by a cultist, you successfully do so, but you leave footprints or other evidence of trespassing behind that someone will eventually find. If you attempt to bribe a guard to let you sneak into a prison, the guard lets you in—but then demands that you hand over a gemstone you need for an important crafting project before they let you out.\n\nJust like failure with a consequence, the consequences accompanying success don’t need to be immediately apparent. In lieu of other consequences, the Director has the option to gain 2 additional VP at the start of the next combat encounter.\n\nSometimes when a hero rolls a failure without a consequence, the Director can offer to let them succeed with a consequence. Likewise, a hero who rolls a success with a consequence might be given a chance to fail without a consequence if doing so is the better option. For instance, when a hero rolls a 10 on an easy Might test to break down a locked door, that’s a failure. But the Director could offer the player the choice of either not breaking down the door, or breaking down the door and losing 1d6 Stamina as they get injured in the effort.",
        "SUCCESS": "If you succeed on a test without consequence or reward, you simply achieve whatever you set out to do. You climb that wall, sneak by those cultists, or bribe that guard just like you planned it. Smooth.",
        "SUCCESS WITH A REWARD": "If you succeed on a test with a reward, you accomplish whatever you set out to do. But you also gain a little something extra, in the form of momentum or luck that makes the immediate future easier for you or your friends. The Director determines your reward, which is most often related to the task at hand. For instance, if you succeed with a reward while climbing a wall, you might find a ladder at the top that you can lower so any allies climbing after you can do so without needing to make a test. A hero trying to sneak by cultists who succeeds with a reward might then be able to dose the cultists’ nearby water barrel with sleeping poison as they pass by unseen. Succeeding with a reward while bribing a prison guard could mean that the guard will unlock a door for you in addition to forgetting you were ever there.\n\nAs with consequences, the reward that comes with a success doesn’t need to be immediate or apparent. For example, a hero succeeds with a reward on an easy test made to cheat at a high-stakes game of cards with a noble. Not only does the hero win the game, but the Director decides that their reward comes from a servant watching the game who’s impressed with the character’s performance. After the game, the servant approaches the hero, offering a Flying Potion from the noble’s private stash in congratulations and admiration.\n\nSome common rewards accompanying success on a test include the following:\n\n['Automatically accomplishing a related follow-up task that would normally require a test', 'Allowing an ally engaged in the same task to accomplish the task without needing to make the test too', 'Obtaining a consumable supernatural item or useful piece of mundane equipment', 'Learning a piece of helpful information', 'Impressing or ingratiating yourself with someone who grants you a small favor', 'Noticing a hidden danger well before it strikes, giving you time to avoid or prepare for it']\n\nIn lieu of other rewards, the Director can also decide that a hero who succeeds on a test with a reward earns the players a hero token (see Hero Tokens).",
        "OPTION: LET PLAYERS PITCH CONSEQUENCES AND REWARDS": "['Coming up with consequences and rewards for tests can be a big part of the fun for many Directors, but even the best of us occasionally run low on ideas. That’s why the game gives the default option of consequences and rewards in the form of Villain Power and hero tokens. However, if you’re a Director who prefers narrative consequences and rewards, consider asking the players to pitch you different consequences and rewards when they make a test. You can reject, add to, or modify their ideas as you see fit. Players who take this option should understand that they need to pitch real consequences when they suffer one, and not minor rewards disguised as consequences.']"
      },
      "HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?": {
        "TESTS DURING COMBAT": "Many (but not all) tests that a hero might make during combat are made as maneuvers. See *Make a Test in Maneuvers* for more information."
      },
      "CAN I TRY AGAIN?": "In many cases when you fail a test, you can’t attempt the test again unless the circumstances of the test change. For instance, if you attempt an Agility test to pick a lock and fail, you can’t attempt to pick the lock again unless you get some better lockpicks, oil the lock, have someone demonstrate how to pick a similar lock, and so on.\n\nThe Director decides when the circumstances have changed enough to allow a new attempt at a test."
    },
    "HEROES MAKE TESTS": {
      "NPCS ROLL FOR DECEPTIVE TASKS": "At times, a hero and an NPC might oppose each other in a scenario where the Director chooses for the NPC to make a test instead of a player. This occurs when an NPC undertakes an action the heroes aren’t aware of or aren’t seeking actively to notice. By having the NPC roll in these scenarios, the Director can keep secret the fact that the task is happening, as well as its outcome.\n\nFor example, if an assassin attempts to ambush the heroes while they sit around a campfire without anyone keeping watch for danger, the assassin makes an Agility test to sneak up on the heroes unnoticed. The Director rolls and doesn’t reveal the result until the heroes actually realize someone is approaching their camp. If the assassin fails the test, the heroes notice immediately as their assailant loudly steps on a twig. If the assassin succeeds, the heroes don’t notice until the assailant is right on top of them. But if any player had said that their hero was on the lookout for danger, that hero would make an Intuition test instead.\n\nAn NPC might also make a Presence test if they lie to the heroes, as long as the heroes have no reason to believe the character would be deceptive. You’ll know if the heroes are wary in that way, because the players will ask if they can make a test to discern the NPC’s honesty.\n\nThe difficulty of the NPC’s test can be modified by the skills and characteristics of the heroes they attempt to deceive, in the same way NPC statistics can modify a hero’s test difficulty.\n\nAs an optional rule, the Director is also free to ask the heroes to make a reactive test to a deceptive NPC action instead (see *Reactive Tests*) whenever they see fit.",
      "OPTIONAL RULE: OPPOSED POWER ROLLS": "In the very rare occurrence that two or more heroes are in conflict with each other in a way that requires them to make tests, the Director can have all the heroes involved make a test. The hero with the highest result on their power roll wins. You can’t earn a reward as part of these opposed power rolls, and they don’t follow the typical difficulty structure or have three different tiers of possible outcomes.\n\nFor example, if your hero attempts to sneak by an allied hero, you would make an Agility test opposed by the player of the other character making an Intuition test. If your hero gets the higher result, you sneak by without the other hero noticing. If the other hero gets a higher result, they catch you in the act of sneaking. If multiple sneaking heroes attempt to get by multiple heroes on the lookout for sneaks, then each character makes a test and all the results are compared to determine which heroes on guard notice which sneaking heroes.\n\nIn the event of a tie in an opposed test, the state of the scene doesn’t change. In the previous example, a tie means that if a hero on guard duty didn’t know a sneaking hero was there, then the guard hero remains oblivious. If the guard did know the sneak was out there somewhere and the sneak is trying to avoid being noticed, a tie means that the guard still knows the sneak is there.\n\nThe Director can also use opposed power rolls when heroes face off against important NPCs using tests."
    },
    "REACTIVE TESTS": "At certain times when a hero isn’t engaged in overcoming a task, the Director might ask the player of the hero to make a test without context, explaining the test only after the power roll is made. This often happens when a hero has a chance of knowing or noticing something of significance that the player doesn’t know to look for or ask about.\n\nReactive tests are typically made in the following circumstances, though the Director can call for them in any appropriate scenario:\n\n['**Hidden Environmental Features**: The Director asks for an Intuition test to notice a secret door, a hidden trap, or some other disguised environmental feature.', '**Hidden Monsters**: The Director calls for an Intuition test to notice a hidden monster (or they could use the rules in *NPCs Roll for Deceptive Tasks*).', '**Hidden Motives**: The Director can ask for an Intuition test during a conversation to gauge how well a hero can read an NPC, judging whether they’re lying, withholding information, or concealing an emotional response. (The Director could also use the rules in *NPCs Roll for Deceptive Tasks*.)', '**Recall Lore**: The Director might ask a hero to make a Reason test when dealing with a new object, a piece of information, or an event to see what history or details the hero might already know about it.']\n\nDIRECTOR’S OPTION: SECRET REACTIVE TESTS\n\nSome Directors prefer to make the power rolls for reactive tests for the heroes rather than asking the players to do so. This allows the Director to make the rolls when appropriate for hidden objects, creatures, motivations, and information without tipping off the players that there is information to be gained. Having the Director roll requires the Director to have everyone’s characteristics and skills written down (whether physically or digitally) for easy reference.",
    "SKILLS": {
      "APPLYING SKILLS": {
        "MIXING CHARACTERISTICS AND SKILLS": "The bonuses from characteristics and the +2 from skills are separate and can apply to the same roll. Although certain skills are often paired with one characteristic more than others, a skill can apply to any characteristic test that makes sense. The Director has the final say on which characteristic is used to complete a task and can call for a different characteristic based on the circumstances.\n\nFor example, intimidating someone with a purely verbal threat is a Presence test. But if a player describes their character tearing a log in half with their bare hands to intimidate a foe, the Director is likely to call for a Might test instead. The Intimidate skill applies to both tests. In the same way, scaling the side of a building is covered by a Might test, but if a hero does a series of leaps from one balcony to another to reach a roof, the Director could call for an Agility test instead. The Climb skill applies to both of these tests."
      },
      "MANY SPECIFIC SKILLS": "This game includes a big list of skills, and each is fairly specific. For example, instead of one Athletics skill that covers climbing, jumping, swimming, and lifting heavy objects, your character might use separate Climb, Jump, Lift, and Swim skills. Instead of a Thievery skill that covers picking locks, picking pockets, and disabling traps, the game has three skills: Pick Lock, Pick Pocket, and Sabotage.\n\nWe made the decision to have a lot of specific skills based on our design goals. First, having skills this specific means that you will frequently make tests that don’t use one of your character’s skills and simply apply a characteristic. By not having a few broader skills, it means that having a character who covers the spread of every skill is actually impossible. Luckily, the math of the game doesn’t require you to have a skill to have a decent chance of success on a test. That means heroes can attempt tasks without the help of a skill just because someone needs to do it, and that is pretty darn heroic!\n\nSince players don’t need to be worried about their characters covering a wide spread of skills, they’re free to choose the skills they think fit their heroes best and are the most fun to work with. In this way, you can get pretty specific with the hero you want to make. Maybe you’re thinking about an elementalist who has a gymnastic background in jumping and tumbling, and who also studied religion and blacksmithing. You can make that in our game! Having a specific backstory is part of cinematic storytelling.\n\nOur rules for skills allow for them to be flexibly applied to any test that is appropriate for the skill. This encourages clever thinking. A player can ask the Director, “I want to impress the duke with a story about how I ascended the sheer Cliffs of Azgahnan. Can I use my Climb skill to get a +2 bonus to my Presence test?” That’s great! Getting creative like that is a lot of fun. It paints a visual picture and it’s tactical thinking! However, if the skills in a game are too broad in the kinds of activities they represent, that sometimes encourages players to find a way to apply the same skill over and over again with as many tests as possible. This isn’t fun for anyone, and doesn’t make a very compelling story.",
      "SKILL GROUPS": {
        "FOR THE DIRECTOR: MAKE YOUR OWN SKILLS": "['Directors should feel free to make their own skills that they feel are relevant and useful to their campaigns and adventures. For instance, the game doesn’t have a Brewing skill for brewing ale or a Painting skill for making art because those aren’t tasks that typically come up or require a test in a game about fighting monsters and saving the world. However, a Director could decide that their campaign involves poisoned barrels of ale and large amounts of counterfeit art, and that adding these two new skills to the game would make it more fun for the players. The Director simply needs to pick a group for these new skills—in this case, crafting makes sense. They then let the players know that they can swap out any crafting skill they have for these new skills.']",

        },
        "ARE ALL SKILLS EQUAL?": "['This game has a big list of skills, and it’s impossible for us or anyone else to know in advance which will be most useful during a campaign. For instance, the Swim skill might be used constantly during a campaign that takes place on the ocean and has heroes exploring underwater ruins, but it won’t come up as much in a campaign that takes place entirely in a vast desert. The Psionics skill might come up a lot in a campaign where voiceless talkers are the main foes, and Magic might be more useful in a game where the heroes take on a circle of evil wizards.', 'If you’re worried about whether a skill you’d like to take will be useful, discuss your skill list with the Director after you create a hero. At the Director’s discretion, you can swap out any skill you have with any other skill in the same group.']"
      }
    },
    "ASSIST A TEST": "You can attempt to assist another creature with a test they make, provided you have a skill that applies to the test, the other creature isn’t using that same skill on the test, and you can describe how your character helps to the Director’s satisfaction. In other words, your attempt to help has to make sense, and you have to bring some useful expertise to the table. Helping another creature sneak by shouting encouragement at them isn’t going to make them stealthier.\n\nWhen you attempt to assist another creature, make an easy test using the skill you choose, and with a characteristic chosen by the Director based on the action you take to help. The outcome of that test determines the bonus applied to the test you’re assisting:\n\n['**11 or lower**: You get in the way or make things worse. The creature takes a bane on their test.', '**12–16**: Your help grants the other creature an edge on their test.', '**17+**: Your help gives the other creature a double edge on their test.']\n\nFor example, if you want to use the Flirt skill to help another hero pick a jailor’s pocket, the Director might ask you to make a Presence test using Flirt. The outcome of that test determines the bonus you provide to the other hero’s Agility test to pick the pocket.",
    "GROUP TESTS": {
      "GROUP TEST DIFFICULTY": "The Director determines the difficulty of a group test the same way they do for individual tests. Group tests can be easy, medium, or hard.",
      "MAKING A GROUP TEST": "Each hero participating in the group test makes the test individually as usual, but the Director waits until all the tests have been made to interpret the results. A hero who is participating in the group test can’t assist another hero participating in the test.",
      "GROUP TEST OUTCOME": "When interpreting the outcome of a group test, the Director first determines if the task succeeded or not before figuring out rewards and consequences. If half or more of the heroes making the group test succeed, then the group test succeeds. Otherwise, the group test fails.\n\nIf the heroes succeeded and half or more of them obtained a reward from the test, the Director gives the group a collective reward and ignores any consequences incurred in the test. This collective reward should be equivalent to earning two individual rewards. In fact, it could be two consumable items, juicy pieces of information, or hero tokens. However, it could also be something more tailored to the task. For instance, if the heroes earn a collective reward while sneaking through the camp of an enemy army, the Director might allow them to sabotage a bunch of war engines or steal a few horses on their way out.\n\nIf the heroes failed the group test and more than half of them incurred a consequence as a result, the Director gives the group a collective consequence and ignores any earned rewards. This collective consequence should affect everyone. An easy option is for the stress of failing the test to cause each hero to take a bane on their next power roll or for the Director to gain 2 VP per hero at the start of the next combat encounter, but the consequence could also be tailored to the task. For instance, if the heroes fail in their attempt to sneak through the camp of an enemy army, they’re spotted and the camp immediately goes on alert as waves of enemies attack them.\n\nIf fewer than half the heroes get a consequence or reward on their individual tests, then the group test simply succeeds or fails."
    },
    "MONTAGE TESTS": {
      "TIME AND STAKES": "As the name suggests, montage tests create a kind of cinematic montage in the action of the game. A montage test can take place over the course of several hours or days, with each individual test or other activity set up as a brief vignette within the montage, and starring one of the heroes. Combat encounters, negotiations, and other challenges and scenes can break up a montage test (see Sample Montage Test below).\n\nThe Director should deploy montage tests only when the players are engaged in overcoming a goal that has stakes for the story and some sort of pressure, such as a looming deadline or impending harm. A montage test is great for a race to get to another location before an enemy army does, a chase to escape or catch up to a foe, weathering a hazard, preparing a village for war, or similar activities. Low- or no-stakes activities such as travel through a forest with no time pressure, or training during a respite to use a new kit, can be narrated in montage style, but they don’t require a montage test.",
      "DIRECTOR SETS THE SCENE": "At the start of a montage test, the Director should describe the scenario underlying the task at hand, and the various challenges the heroes might face as they attempt to collectively accomplish it. For example, if the heroes are attempting to chase down a pickpocket through a crowded market, the Director might talk about the throngs of innocent people blocking the way forward, obscuring the characters’ vision, and making noise that complicates attempts to hear the thief’s nimble footsteps. There are also traveling carts to dodge, the speed and dexterity of the pursued character to contend with, and a pack of stray dogs who chase after anyone who sprints through the market. Describing these obstacles gives the heroes ideas about what they’re trying to overcome as they attempt to achieve their goals.",
      "INDIVIDUAL TESTS IN MONTAGE TESTS": "The difficulty of each individual test in a montage test is set by the Director and can vary from test to test. For instance, if the heroes are preparing the defenses of a village threatened by a band of approaching raiders, the Director might decide that a character who wants to dig a trench around the village needs to make an easy Might test. Another hero wants to train the untested farmers of the village in the ways of war, and the Director decides this is a hard Reason test.\n\nThe same rules and guidelines that apply to all individual tests apply here. If a hero has a clever, out-of-the-box idea that the Director thinks should automatically succeed without rolling dice, it does. If the circumstances of the test should grant an edge or a bane, they do. Individual test outcomes shouldn’t halt the story.\n\nThe Director should couch each success or failure as it relates to the overall goal of the montage test. If the heroes are trying to reach an ancient temple, failing a Might test to ford a river in their path doesn’t mean they don’t cross the river and are stuck on the other side. But it could mean that failing to cross the river in a timely manner gives a rival group of villains the chance to beat the party to the temple.\n\nThe rewards and consequences of individual tests made during a montage test should be handled on an individual basis. The Director can use the default additional VP in the next combat encounter for consequences and hero tokens for rewards to keep the montage moving.",
      "CAN’T USE THE SAME SKILL TWICE": "An individual character can’t use the same skill more than once in a montage test. Though multiple heroes can use the same skill, a test or an assist with a specific skill represents each characters’ entire contribution to the montage test with that skill. At the Director’s discretion, this restriction can be lifted for prolonged montage tests, or for montage tests that are limited in scope and have only a small number of skills that apply to them.",
      "NEW CHALLENGES FOR EACH TEST": "In general, when a hero makes a test as part of a montage test, they should choose new obstacles to overcome that haven’t already been tackled as part of the test. If the heroes are chasing a thief through the marketplace and one of them has already distracted the pack of stray dogs with a deft hand and a piece of meat, additional tests made to distract the animals don’t count toward the result of the montage test.\n\nWhen it fits the scenario, the Director can adjust this restriction. If part of a montage test involves searching for people trapped in a burning building, the Director is likely to allow multiple tests to fight or avoid the fire, since this will happen throughout the montage test, not just once.",
      "DIRECTOR CAN INTRODUCE MORE CHALLENGES": "During a montage test, a Director can introduce new challenges for the heroes to face. While attempting to run out of a burning building from the top floor, the characters might discover that by the time they reach the second floor, beams are starting to fall and glass windows are exploding as the structure begins to collapse. These new challenges can be incorporated into the tests the heroes subsequently make.",
      "TOTAL SUCCESSES AND FAILURES": "The Director or another player will track the total number of successes and failures the heroes earn during a montage test. Every montage test has a **success limit** and a **failure limit**. When the number of successful tests equals the success limit, the montage test ends and the heroes achieve total success (see Montage Test Outcomes). The montage test can also end when the number of failed tests equals the failure limit, and the heroes suffer total failure.",
      "LIMITED ROUNDS": "A montage test should last only 2 montage test rounds. If the heroes don’t end the montage test by achieving the success limit or failure limit, the montage test ends when the second montage test round is over. This time limit helps to keep a montage test from becoming a slog, and prevents heroes from simply using their turns to assist the one hero with the best chance of success. This can inspire each hero to be a more active participant in the montage test. That said, the Director can increase the number of rounds a montage test lasts if they wish to create a particularly grueling challenge.",
      "MONTAGE TEST DIFFICULTY": {
        "MONTAGE TEST DIFFICULTY TABLE": "| Difficulty | Success Limit | Failure Limit |\n| ---------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| Easy       | 5             | 5             |\n| Moderate   | 6             | 4             |\n| Hard       | 7             | 3             |\n\nFor larger or smaller groups, you can make the following adjustments to keep montage tests achievable but challenging:\n\n['For four or fewer heroes, decrease the success limit and failure limits by 1 (to a minimum of 2) for every hero fewer than five. For example, if your group has only three heroes, an easy montage test has a success and failure limit of 3.', 'For six or more heroes, increase the success and failure limits by 1 for every hero more than five.']"
      },
      "MONTAGE TEST OUTCOMES": {
        "TOTAL SUCCESS": "If the heroes earn a total success, they achieve what they set out to do without complication. For instance, if the heroes engaged in a montage test to see if they can cross a desert to reach a city before a tyrant’s army arrived there and leveled the place, a total success sees them arrive at the city gates with plenty of time to warn people of the impending assault. The heroes earn **1 Victory** when they achieve total success on an easy or moderate montage test, and **2 Victories** on a hard montage test.",
        "PARTIAL SUCCESS": "If the heroes earn a partial success, they succeed at what they set out to do, but there is a complication or a cost involved. For instance, when crossing the desert to reach and warn the city of the tyrant’s army, a mixed success sees the characters arrive at the city gates with the enemy forces just behind them. Alternatively, the Director might allow the heroes to arrive well before the army, but they don’t cover their movements well enough. The tyrant realizes the city has been warned and decides to call in a favor to have a powerful dragon join the siege. The heroes earn **1 Victory** when they achieve partial success on a hard or moderate montage test.",
        "TOTAL FAILURE": "If the heroes suffer total failure, they don’t achieve what they set out to do. Just as with standard tests, failure on a group test shouldn’t bring a story to a halt. Total failure should make things more interesting and challenging! With a total failure in a montage test to cross the desert and warn the city, the characters arrive at the city to find it already under siege by the tyrant."
      },
      "SAMPLE MONTAGE TEST": "Four heroes must cross the vast and inhospitable Infinite Desert to warn the city of Ahset that the tyrannical Empress Vardo is coming to conquer them. If the characters arrive in time, they can organize the defenses of the city, giving its people a greater chance of defeating the tyrant.\n\nThe Director determines that crossing the desert is a montage test of hard difficulty. With four heroes involved, the success limit is 6 and the failure limit is 2 as the montage test begins:\n\n['When the test begins, the Director sets the scene. They tell the players that the desert has extreme temperatures, sudden sandstorms, high dunes to cross, deep sand, chasms, and quicksand lakes. The Director decides that challenges of dunes, deep sand, and quicksand can be tackled multiple times in the test, since the Infinite Desert is filled with these hazards.', '**Urdoncara**, a fury, starts things off by asking to make an Intuition test using the Nature skill to predict the best times of day to travel and rest. She wants the party to avoid the worst of the desert’s extreme temperatures and any sandstorms or other weather phenomena, so that their journey is quickened. The Director decides this is an easy test. Urdoncara makes the test and gets a result of 12, earning 1 success for the montage test.', '**Loric**, a tactician, wants to make a Reason test using the Climb skill to lead the party over dunes and other hazards with minimal effort. The Director allows the attempt, but says that knowing what makes one dune easier to climb than another is difficult, setting the difficulty at medium. Loric gets a 9 on the test and fails with a major consequence, which the Director decides will cause him to take a bane on his next power roll due to the exertion. The montage test currently has 1 success and 1 failure.', '**Karrel**, an elementalist, thinks the group might cross the desert faster if they have specially modified sandshoes that distribute their weight and prevent their feet from sinking into the sand. The Director loves the idea and decides that making four pairs of the shoes while traveling the desert is a medium Reason test. Karrel gets to use their Tailoring skill and winds up with a result of 13—a success with a consequence. The Director gains an additional 2 VP at the start of the next combat encounter as a consequence, but the group now has 2 successes and 1 failure on the montage test.', '**Adrian**, a conduit, offers to scout ahead for the group with an Intuition test, using the Navigate skill to find the best path forward and avoid hazards such as chasms and quicksand. The Director thinks this straightforward task of acting as lookout in a vast desert is an easy task. Adrian smashes it with a 21, and the Director decides to get creative with the reward. Adrian’s lookout skills grant the next hero to act in the montage test an edge on their test. At the end of the first montage test round, the heroes have 3 successes and 1 failure.']\n\nBefore the next montage test round, the Director pauses the montage test to run a battle with a kingfissure worm, who attacks the heroes as they cross over an ancient ruin partially buried in the sand. After the heroes defeat the kingfissure worm, the test continues:\n\n['**Urdoncara** wants to make a Might test using the Lift skill to carry most of the group’s equipment as they cross the desert, allowing her allies to move more quickly while she keeps up with her superior endurance. The Director thinks this arduous task has a hard difficulty. Urdoncara gets a 17 on the test thanks to the edge from Adrian’s earlier success. The montage test has 4 successes and 1 failure.', '**Loric**, eager to prove himself after his last failure, asks to make a Might test using the Lead skill, representing tying a rope around his waist to drag his weaker friends over the tallest dunes. The Director likes the idea, but doesn’t think the Lead skill applies to the task. He tells Loric that Lift is more appropriate, since the tactician is using their physical skill to aid their friends and not really doing anything interpersonal. Loric agrees, and the Director sets the test at medium difficulty. Making the test with a bane because of his previous failure, the tactician rolls a 15, which is a success with a consequence. The montage test has 5 successes and 1 failure, but the consequence gives the Director another 2 VP at the start of the next combat encounter.', 'Since the group needs only 1 more success to achieve total success, **Karrel** says she’d like to assist **Adrian** in whatever task he decides to take on. Adrian wants to recall lore about the Khem-hor—the inhabitants of the Infinite Desert—to remember their time-honored travel techniques using the History skill. Karrel has the Culture skill, which she can use to assist by providing information about the lives and society of the Khem-hor. She makes a Reason test to assist and gets a 16, granting Adrian an edge on his upcoming test.', '**Adrian** attempts to recall lore about the Khem-hor, wanting to see if he can remember any of their travel techniques from his studies of the history of the region. The Director has him make a hard Reason test with an edge, thanks to Karrel’s input on the current state of Khem-hor culture. Adrian gets a 17, and the Director decides that the conduit recalls a shortcut through a canyon tunnel that leads directly to Ahset, avoiding a vast lake of quicksand. The heroes get their sixth success in the montage test, achieving total success, and earn 2 Victories.']\n\nThe heroes could have attempted other tests during their travels, such as an Agility test using the Stealth skill to lead the group through dangerous shortcuts in the desert without being seen or waylaid by predators, a Reason test using the Nature skill to find enough food and water to keep the group hydrated and fed, or a Presence test using the Music skill to inspire allies to travel faster with song."

    "RESISTANCE ROLLS": "Resistance rolls are special power rolls made to avoid harmful effects from traps, hazards, and other creatures’ attacks and abilities. You don’t decide when it’s time to make a resistance roll. Instead, you make one in response to a dangerous situation when the rules or the Director call for it. The higher the result of the resistance roll, the less harm the effect does to your character.\n\nFor example, a hero who activates a fire trap might need to make the following resistance roll:\n\n**Resistance + Agility**:\n\n['11 or lower: 9 fire damage', '12–16: 6 fire damage', '17+: 2 fire damage']",

      "CAELIAN EMPIRE": "The Caelian Empire dominated five of the seven regions of Orden three thousand years ago. During the height of this most recent human empire, all humans (including folks from Vanigar in the far north, but not folks from the islands of Ix) learned to speak the Caelian tongue. For many, especially the noble classes and the well-to-do, Caelian effectively replaced their native language.\n\nSome thirteen hundred years after the fall of the Caelian Empire, the languages of the different regions of the empire are enjoying a resurgence. Still, the Caelian tongue is spoken by most humans in most regions to one extent or another.\n\nMost people in Orden can speak and understand some Caelian, simply because the empire was so powerful and so widespread. Anyone trading with the empire or living near its borders or under its influence eventually learned to speak Caelian, including dwarves, elves, orcs, lizardfolk, and goblins. If you speak more than one language in Orden, your second language is almost certainly Caelian.

        "LANGUAGE USAGE": "**Hyrallic** is the primary language of the high elves in Orden. Although young for an elven language, Hyrallic is older than almost all other modern cultural languages, save those of the dwarves. As a result, while anyone who lives near or trades with a human culture probably speaks at least a little Caelian, most nobles across all ancestries make sure their children or offspring speak Hyrallic. Caelian is new from many cultures’ point of view, while Hyrallic as a language for diplomacy is considered cultured and traditional.\n\n**Yllyric** is the cultural language of wode elves, and also the common language among those who defend and protect the natural forests of Orden.\n\nWithin any document concerning the workings of machines, masonry, or geology, you are likely to find a healthy supply of jargon using **Zaliac**, the most popular dwarven language. Even when such texts aren’t fully written in Zaliac, they use a lot of dwarven language when describing esoteric, complex ideas.\n\nJust as Zaliac is used in engineering, contract law isn’t written purely in **Anjal**, the dominant language of the Seven Cities of Hell. But, a lot of the legal jargon in any contract, as well as some of the language of trial courts, features many Anjal words. People are sticklers for detail in the Seven Cities, making their language popular among lawyers.\n\nIn the same way that intelligent creatures in Orden who live near or trade with other cultures use **Caelian** as a common language, the denizens of the World Below, the Dark Under All, often speak **Variac**, the language of the voiceless talkers."

However, that narrative flavor has no effect on how an ability can be used. For example, the fury’s *Impaling Strike* ability allows you to grab a target, setting up the idea of harpooning your monstrous foe with a sword, then wrenching them in close before pulling your weapon free. But you can use that ability with an axe, a mace, a hammer, or any other weapon.",

      "CHARGE": "Abilities with the Charge keyword can be used with the Charge action in place of a melee free strike (see Charge in Actions in Combat).",
      "MAGIC": "Magic-keyword abilities are used by creatures who can cast spells, have innate magical features, or wield magic items. These abilities do magical things such as create rays of fire, open swirling portals, or summon creatures.",
      "MELEE": "Abilities with the Melee keyword can be used only over very short distances, typically within a creature’s reach, because they require you to touch someone or something with your body, a weapon, or an implement.",
      "PSIONIC": "Psionic-keyword abilities are used by creatures who can manifest psionic powers, have innate psionic features, or wield psionic items. These abilities might create blasts of psychic energy, move objects with telekinesis, or slow down time with chronopathy.",
      "RANGED": "Abilities with the Ranged keyword can be used to affect creatures who are too far away to touch.",
      "RESISTANCE": "Abilities with the Resistance keyword require the target to make a resistance roll to lessen or avoid their effect.\n\n(Playtest note: Only monsters and villains have Resistance-keyword abilities right now.)",
      "WEAPON": "The Weapon keyword is used in attacks that are made with blades, bows, and other such items.

Your kit determines the types of weapons you wield and use with weapon abilities (see Kits).",
      "IT’S NOT ALL ATTACKS!": "['The Attack keyword and phrases like “makes an attack” are reserved for abilities that have a creature specifically targeting other creatures or objects (not an area) and dealing harm to them by making a power roll. Other abilities that target areas of effect, or that require the target to make a resistance roll instead of having the creature using the ability make the roll, are not attacks. They instead use the Area and Resistance keywords, respectively. That means if a feature distinctly interacts with an attack (for instance, the conduit’s Holy Infusion triggered action), that feature has no effect on abilities with the Area or Resistance keyword.']"

    "TYPE": {

    "DISTANCE": {
      "MELEE": "Abilities with a distance of “Reach X” require you to touch a creature with your body, a weapon, or an implement. X is the distance in squares at which you can physically make contact with another creature or object targeted by the ability. For instance, a distance of “Reach 2” can be used to target creatures or objects within 2 squares of you.",
      "RANGED": "Abilities with a distance noted as “Ranged” can be used to target creatures who are more than a touch away. Ranged distances are presented as “Ranged X,” with X being the number of squares away a creature or object can be while still allowing you to target them with the ability. For instance, a distance of “Ranged 5” can be used to target creatures or objects within 5 squares of you.\n\nIf you make a ranged attack while an enemy is adjacent to you, you have a bane on the attack’s power roll.",
      "MELEE OR RANGED": "Some abilities have a melee distance and a ranged distance. When you use such an ability, you choose whether to use it as a melee or a ranged ability. The ability never has both the Melee and Ranged keywords at the same time. For example, if you have the Cloak and Dagger kit, which has a weapon damage bonus to melee and ranged abilities, only one bonus at a time applies to an ability with the Melee or Ranged keywords.",
      "AREA ABILITIES": "Area abilities cover an area, creating an effect within that area that lets you target multiple creatures or objects at once. When an ability allows you to create an area of effect, you are sometimes given a distance, noted as “within X,” that describes how many squares away from you the area can be. If an area ability doesn’t originate from you, then at least 1 square of the area of effect must be within that distance and your line of effect. This square is referred to as the origin square of the area of effect. The area of effect can spread from the origin square however you choose, as long as the area of effect conforms to the shape and arrangement rules of that particular area.\n\nUnless otherwise noted, area abilities don’t pass through solid barriers such as walls or ceilings or spread around corners. These obstructions stop areas from spreading. As long as you have line of effect and distance to the origin square, you can place an area ability to include one or more squares where you don’t have line of effect (see Line of Effect below).\n\nAn area ability might use any of the following areas of effect:\n\n['**Aura**: When an ability creates an aura, it is expressed as “X aura.” Aura areas always originate from you and move with you for the duration of the ability that created them. A creature must be within X squares of you to be targeted by an aura ability.', '**Burst**: When an ability creates a burst area, it is expressed as “X burst.” Burst areas always originate from you. A creature must be within X squares of you to be targeted with a burst ability.', '**Cube**: When an ability affects a cubic area, it is expressed as “X cube.” X is the length of all the area’s sides.', '**Line**: When an ability affects a linear area, it is expressed as “A × B line.” This means that A equals the line’s length in squares, while B equals the line’s width and height in squares.', '**Wall**: When an ability creates a wall, it is expressed as “X wall,” where X equals how many squares are used to make the wall. When you place a wall, you can build it one square at a time, but each square must share at least one side (not just a corner) with another square of the wall. You can stack squares on top of each other to make the wall higher. Unless otherwise stated, a wall can’t be placed in occupied squares, and a wall blocks line of effect.', '**Special**: Some abilities create a unique area of effect. The distance entry of such abilities specifies how the area is created.']",
      "SELF": "If an ability has a distance of “Self,” that ability originates from or affects only you. The ability’s description specifies how it works."

    "TARGET": {
      "CREATURE": "If an ability targets one or more creatures, you can have it target any creature within the ability’s distance. You aren’t an eligible creature target for your own abilities unless those abilities also have “self” as a target (see below).",
      "OBJECT": "If an ability targets one or more objects, you can have it target any object within the ability’s distance. Unless otherwise noted, objects have poison and psychic immunity. When an ability can target creatures and objects, the ability can damage objects. However, unless otherwise noted or if the Director decides otherwise, objects are immune to an ability’s other effects.",
      "ENEMY": "If an ability targets one or more enemies, you can use the ability to target only creatures who are hostile to you. Typically, you decide who counts as an enemy, though the Director has the final say.",
      "ALLY": "If an ability targets one or more allies, you can use the ability to target only creatures who are friendly to you. Typically, you decide who counts as an ally, though the Director has the final say. You aren’t an eligible ally target for your own abilities unless those abilities also have “self” as a target.",
      "SELF": "If an ability targets “self,” then you are a valid target for the ability.",

    "ABILITY POWER ROLL": {
      "ABILITIES WITH DAMAGE AND EFFECTS": {
        "CRITICAL HIT": "When you make a power roll as part of an attack or action and the total of the roll is 19 or 20 before adding your characteristic (a natural 19 or natural 20), you score a critical hit. This allows you to immediately take an additional action after resolving the power roll, whether or not it’s your turn and even if you are dazed (see Conditions).",
        "DURING THE MOVE": "Certain ability effects allow you to move and affect other creatures or objects during that move, such as the shadow’s Blade Dance ability. For such abilities, the move begins in the space you first leave when you move, and ends in the last space you move into."
      },
      "ROLL AGAINST MULTIPLE CREATURES": "When an ability targets multiple creatures, you make one power roll and apply the result to all the creatures you target. If you have edges or banes against some but not all of your targets, you might apply a different tier of result to individual targets.\n\nFor example, if you target three creatures with an attack ability and your result is 11, each of the targets should be affected by the tier 1 result of the ability. However, if you gain an edge on attacks against one of the targets to add 2 to the power roll, your result against that target is 13 and that target is affected by the tier 2 result of the ability."
    },
    "RESISTANCE ROLLS": "Some abilities that are used by the heroes’ foes have the target of the ability make a resistance roll instead of the creature using the ability making a power roll. These abilities have the Resistance keyword, indicating that the target rolls to see how well they can resist the ability. For instance, the goblin cursespitter’s Eye of Surlach ability forces a target to make an Intuition resistance roll:\n\n**Target Resists + Intuition:**\n\n['11 or lower: 6 corruption damage; weakened (INU ends)', '12–16: 5 corruption damage; weakened (EoT)', '17+: 2 corruption damage']\n\nBecause a resistance roll measures how well a target shakes off an ability’s damage and effects, the higher the tier result of the roll, the weaker the ability’s damage and effects.",
    "EFFECT": "Many abilities that require power rolls also have effect entries describing additional effects or rules for how the ability is used. If an ability doesn’t require a power roll, it has an effect entry that describes how it works.",
    "SPEND RESOURCE": "Some abilities have a “Spend X [Heroic Resource]” entry. These are similar to effect entries, except they cost Heroic Resources to use. You must spend X of your Heroic Resource to activate the effect. If the entry reads “Spend [Heroic Resource]” with no number, then you can spend as much of your Heroic Resource as you like to increase the effect’s impact, as described in the entry’s details.",
    "STACKING UNIQUE EFFECTS": "The unique effects of different abilities are combined if their durations and targets overlap. However, the effects of the same ability used multiple times don’t add together. Instead, the most impactful result—such as the highest bonus—from each use of the ability applies. The most recent ability applies for determining duration.\n\nDifferent effects that impose the same condition (see Conditions) don’t stack to impose the condition twice. For example, if a hero is targeted by numerous creatures whose abilities can halve a target’s recovery value, the hero’s recovery value is only halved once.",
    "ENDING EFFECTS": {
      "EOT": "If an effect ends with “(EoT)” at the end of its description, a creature suffers the effect until the end of their next turn.",
      "RESISTANCE ROLLS AND EFFECTS": "If an effect ends with “([CHARACTERISTIC] resistance ends)” at the end of its description, then a creature suffering the effect can make a resistance roll at the end of your turn to remove the effect. Unless otherwise specified, a resistance roll to end an effect is set up as follows:\n\n**Power Roll + [Specified Characteristic]:**\n\n['11 or lower: The effect persists', '12–16: The effect ends at the end of your next turn', '17+: The effect ends immediately']\n\nHeroes’ abilities don’t apply effects that require resistance rolls, to prevent the Director from doing a lot of tracking and rolling.",
      "EOE": "If an effect ends with “(EoE)” at the end of its description, a creature suffers the effect until the end of the encounter. In general, enemies’ abilities don’t apply end-of-encounter effects to heroes, since heroes should always have a chance to get back in the fight!\n\nBoss creatures have the End Effect trait, which allows them to end EoE effects at the end of their turn in exchange for taking damage."
    },
    "LINE OF EFFECT": "To target a creature or object with an ability, including attacking the creature or object, you must have line of effect to that creature or object. If a solid object, such as a wall or pillar, completely blocks the creature from you, then you don’t have line of effect to them. If you’re not sure if you have line of effect to a creature, imagine drawing a straight line from any corner of the space you occupy on the map to any corner of a space the creature occupies. If you can do this with at least one corner connecting to another with no obstruction in between, you have line of effect to the creature.\n\nAt the Director’s discretion, flimsy or fragile obstructions such as a glass window or linen curtains don’t block line of effect and might be automatically broken or torn by attacks made through them.\n\nIf you want to create an area of effect in a specific area, you must have line of effect to at least one of the squares in that area. See Area Abilities.",
    "STRAIGHT LINE": "Whenever your character moves or when you or another creature are force moved, that movement is typically in a straight line. Abilities that allow you to move or to forcibly move another creature often talk about moving straight toward or away from another creature or an object. Although a line of travel must be straight, it doesn’t have to travel a straight line of squares on the grid.",
    "CONDITIONS": {
      "BLEEDING": "While you are bleeding, you can’t regain Stamina.",
      "DAZED": "While you are dazed, you can do only one thing on your turn: use a maneuver, use an action, or take a move action. You also can’t use triggered actions, free triggered actions, or free maneuvers.",
      "FRIGHTENED": "If you are frightened, attacks you make against the source of your fear take a bane. If that source is a creature, their attacks against you gain an edge. You can’t willingly move closer to the source of your fear if you know the location of that source. If you gain the frightened condition from one source while already frightened by a different source, the new condition replaces the old one.",
      "GRABBED": "While you are grabbed, your speed is 0, you can’t be force moved, you can’t use the Knockback maneuver, and you take a bane on attacks that don’t target the creature grabbing you. If the creature grabbing you moves, they bring you with them. If the creature’s size is equal to or less than yours, their speed is halved while they have you grabbed.\n\nThe creature grabbing you can use a maneuver to move you into an unoccupied space adjacent to them. The creature grabbing you can end the grab at any time (no action required). You can also attempt to escape being grabbed (see Escape Grab in Combat). If you teleport or if the creature grabbing you is force moved to a space that isn’t adjacent to you, you are no longer grabbed.",
      "PRONE": "While you are prone, you are flat on the ground, attacks you make take a bane, and melee attacks made against you gain an edge. You must crawl to move along the ground, which costs you 1 additional square of movement for every square you crawl. You can’t climb, jump, swim, or fly while prone. If you are climbing, flying, or jumping while you are knocked prone, you fall.\n\nWhile prone, you can stand up as a maneuver (see Maneuvers in Combat), unless the ability or effect that imposed the condition says otherwise. You can use a maneuver to make an adjacent prone creature stand up.",
      "RESTRAINED": "While you are restrained, your speed is 0 and you can’t be force moved. Your attacks take a bane, attacks and damaging area powers against you gain an edge, and you have a bane on Might and Agility resistance rolls. If you teleport while restrained, the condition ends.",
      "SLOWED": "While you are slowed, your speed is 2 unless it is already lower.",

  "COMBAT": {
    "SET THE MAP": {
      "HOW BIG IS A SQUARE?": "['It’s helpful to know how big a square is for abilities that heroes and NPCs can use outside of combat. A single square is 5 feet on all sides. The Director can change this measurement to 2 meters, 1 meter, or any other measurement you prefer, as long as that scale stays consistent throughout your game.']",
      "SIZE AND SPACE": "A creature’s size indicates how many squares they occupy during combat, which defines the creature’s space. If a creature’s size is 1, they occupy a space of 1 square. If a creature is larger than 1 square, their size equals the number of squares they take up in length, width, and height. For example, a horse has a size of 2, which means that during combat, they occupy a space that is 2 squares long, 2 squares wide, and 2 squares high. You could also think of that space as a cube that is 2 squares on all sides.\n\nIf a creature is a size 1, their size value includes the letter T, S, M, or L, abbreviations of tiny, small, medium, and large respectively. Since the minimal amount of space a creature can take up during combat is 1, this letter indicates the difference between tiny pixies, small polders, medium humans, and large hakaan, each of which occupy of a space 1 square in combat. These sizes in order from smallest to largest are 1T, 1S, 1M, and 1L.\n\nObjects can also have a size rating. If an object has an O (an abbreviation for oblong) next to its size, it indicates that the object’s size isn’t the number of squares the object occupies, but rather it's relative mass and weight to a creature of equivalent size. If an ability or feature allows you to interact with objects of a certain size that rule includes all objects of that size, oblong or otherwise.\n\nThe Creature and Object Sizes table shows examples sizes of creatures and objects up to size 5, but there is no limit to what a creature or object’s size could be.",
      "CREATURE AND OBJECT SIZES": "| Size | Example Creature | Example Object |\n| ---- | ---------------- | -------------- |\n| 1T   | Pixie            | Potato         |\n| 1S   | Polder           | Heavy armor    |\n| 1M   | Human            | Wardrobe       |\n| 1L   | Hakaan           | Anvil          |\n| 2    | Ogre             | Carriage       |\n| 3    | Treant           | Sailboat       |\n| 4    | Ancient Dragon   | Galley         |\n| 5    | The Kraken       | Castle         |",
      "SIDES": {
        "NPC ALLIES": "['If an NPC ally fights alongside the heroes, the Director should give the players the ally’s stat block and let them control the NPC during combat. The Director has enough to worry about. As well, any missteps, mistakes, or triumphs the ally makes will be thanks to the decisions of the players and not the Director, which can make the outcome of the battle more satisfying for the players.']"
      }
    },
    "COMBAT ROUND": {
      "DETERMINE SURPRISE": "When battle begins, the Director determines which creatures, if any, are caught off guard. Any creature who isn’t ready for combat at the start of an encounter is surprised until the end of the first round of combat. A surprised creature can’t take triggered or free triggered actions, attacks and damaging area powers rolled against them gain an edge, and they have a bane on resistance rolls.\n\nFor example, if the heroes sneak up unnoticed on a camp of marauders and attack, each marauder is surprised. Likewise, if the heroes fail to notice that all the cloaked figures in a tavern are actually brain-devouring zombies, then the heroes are surprised. If one of the heroes notices the disguised undead before the zombies attack but has no opportunity to warn their allies, that hero isn’t surprised but the rest of the characters are.",
      "DETERMINE WHO GOES FIRST": "Sometimes figuring out who gets to take the first turn in combat is automatic. If all the creatures on one side are surprised, then a creature on the other side gets to go first. But if both sides have creatures who aren’t surprised, the Director or a player they choose rolls 1d10. On a result of 6 or greater, the heroes’ side acts first. Otherwise, the other side acts first.",
      "CREATURES TAKE TURNS": {
        "DETERMINING WHO ACTS NEXT": "When it comes to the heroes’ side, the choice of who should act next is intended to give players the opportunity to comment, strategize, and plan. Some tables, in some encounters, might find that the choice of who should act next isn’t obvious, leading to debate. That’s fine. Deliberating about what the group should do next is classic roleplaying.\n\nIn general, though, most groups find that it’s usually only one or two players in a given round who think it best if they act next. And as soon as those players explain why they want to act next and what they plan on doing, the issue is quickly resolved.",
        "ARGUMENT TIMER": "If the players do end up arguing in circles about what to do next, the Director can place a timer on the discussion. Usually, giving the players a warning and 30 seconds to decide who goes next does the trick. If they can’t choose by the end of that time, the Director chooses a hero to act.",
        "ALTERNATIVE INITIATIVE": "['If planning everyone’s turn order isn’t fun for your group, you can leave it to the dice instead. At the start of combat, have each hero, enemy, and group of enemies make an Agility test, then record the results. When it’s time for someone on the heroes’ side to act, the hero with the highest result goes first. On the next hero turn, the hero with the second-highest result takes their turn, and so on. The Director-controlled creatures act the same way. Creatures on the same side should reroll tied Agility tests to determine who among the tied creatures acts before the others.', 'At the Director’s discretion, a hero can swap their turn in the initiative order with another willing hero at the start of a new round of combat. This allows certain abilities that interact with the core initiative system, such as the shadow’s **Hesitation is Weakness** ability, to better work with this alternative system.']",
        "ENEMIES ACT IN GROUPS": "Director-controlled creatures act in groups, with information for building groups found in the Bestiary. When a group of enemies acts, the Director chooses a single creature or minion squad to take a turn. Once that turn is over, the Director chooses another creature in that group to take a turn, continuing until all members of the group have taken their turn."
      },
      "END OF ROUND": "Once all creatures on both sides of a battle have acted, the round ends and a new round begins.",
      "TAKING A TURN": {
        "TRIGGERED ACTIONS AND FREE TRIGGERED ACTIONS": "Your hero might have one or more unique triggered actions, each of which has a specified trigger that allows the action to be used. You can use one triggered action per round, either on your turn or another creature’s turn, but only when the action’s trigger occurs. For instance, a fury hero can use the **Relentless Toss** triggered action to force move a target, but only after an enemy has first tried to force move the fury or one of their allies.\n\nA free triggered action follows the same rules as a triggered action, but it doesn’t count against your limit of one triggered action per round. For instance, a shadow hero can use their **Hesitation is Weakness** ability to take their turn in response to the trigger of another hero ending their turn. But because that ability is a free triggered action, the shadow can still use their **In All This Confusion** triggered action if attacked by an enemy.\n\nIf multiple triggered actions occur in response to the same trigger, any heroes and other player-controlled creatures taking a triggered action or a free triggered action decide among themselves which of those triggered actions are resolved first. Then the Director decides the same for creatures they control.\n\nAny effect that prevents you from making triggered actions also prevents you from making free triggered actions.",
        "FREE MANEUVERS": "Boring stuff like opening an unlocked door, picking up an arrow from the ground, giving an object to an adjacent ally, or drawing a weapon doesn’t require a maneuver or an action. Rather, you can undertake such straightforward activities as free maneuvers on your turn. A free maneuver follows the same rules as a regular maneuver, but you can typically take as many free maneuvers as you like.\n\nAt the Director’s discretion, circumstances could make something that is typically boring more impactful and exciting. For instance, if you need to pick a magic arrow up off the ground during a violent earthquake, what would otherwise be a free maneuver could require a maneuver or an action to accomplish.\n\nLikewise, the nature of an activity might make it too complicated for a free maneuver. For example, picking up the body of an unconscious talent ally to carry them to safety can probably be done as a free maneuver. But if your Might is lacking and you need to pick up a tactician ally decked out in the Shining Armor kit, the Director might determine that you need to use a regular maneuver to hoist their armored form over your shoulders.\n\nAny effect that prevents you from making maneuvers also prevents you from making free maneuvers.",
        "NO-ACTION ACTIVITIES": "Free maneuvers cover most of the simple activities you might want to undertake on your turn. When it isn’t your turn, you can typically undertake even simpler activities requiring no action with the Director’s approval. For instance, shouting out a warning to an ally or dropping an item so another creature can pick it up require no action.\n\nThe Director can limit what kinds of no-action activities you can attempt when it isn’t your turn. For instance, shouting out a warning about an unseen foe to an ally on the ally’s or the foe’s turn requires no action. But the Director might stop you from giving that ally complex tactical advice, saying that doing so instead requires a free maneuver on your turn."
      }
    },
    "MOVEMENT": {
      "CAN’T EXCEED SPEED": "A single move or other effect can never allow a creature to move more squares than their speed, unless the effect specifically states otherwise. For example, a creature with a speed of 5 might have that speed halved to 2. If an ally then targets them with an effect that allows them to move up to 3 squares, the creature can move only 2 squares because that’s their current speed.",
      "SHIFTING": "Whenever you use your move action or when another effect allows you to move, you can instead shift to use up to half the maximum squares of movement the effect allows. Whenever you shift, creatures can’t make opportunity attacks against you during your movement (see Free Strikes).\n\nCertain effects might also allow you to shift a specific number of squares, including many effects that let you shift up to your speed.",
      "MOVEMENT TYPES": {
        "WALK": "Walking is the most common movement type, whether it refers to ambulating on legs, slithering, or some other default method of movement. Unless specified otherwise, all creatures can move over solid horizontal ground without any problem.",
        "BURROW": "A creature with “burrow” in their speed entry can move through dirt vertically or horizontally, and either has the means to breathe while doing so or doesn’t require air to live. Such creatures can’t move through more solid ground, such as stone, unless their stat block says otherwise.",
        "CLIMB OR SWIM": "If a creature’s speed entry includes the word “climb,” they can climb across vertical and horizontal surfaces at full speed. Likewise, if a creature has “swim” in their speed entry, they can swim in liquid at full speed.\n\nCreatures without those types of movement can still climb or swim when a rule allows them to move, but each square of climbing or swimming costs 2 squares of movement. If a surface is difficult to climb (for instance, a sheer cliff or ice-covered wall) or a liquid is hard to swim through (a raging river or whirlpool), the Director can call for a Might test. On a failure, a creature can’t climb or swim but wastes no movement in the attempt. The Director can also impose other consequences to failure, such as being caught in the spinning current of a whirlpool.",
        "CLIMBING OTHER CREATURES": "You can attempt to climb a creature whose size is greater than yours. If the creature is willing, you can climb them without any trouble. If the creature is unwilling, you make the following test:\n\n**Power Roll + Might or Agility:**\n\n['11 or lower: You fail to climb the creature, and they can make a free strike against you.', '12–16: You fail to climb the creature.', '17+: You climb the creature.']\n\nWhile you climb or ride a creature, you gain an edge to melee attacks against them. The creature can use a maneuver to attempt to knock you off. If you are knocked off a creature, you must make the following test:\n\n**Power Roll + Might or Agility:**\n\n['11 or lower: You fall off the creature into an unoccupied adjacent space of your choice, taking falling damage and landing prone as usual (see Falling in Adventuring).', '12–16: You slide down the creature into an unoccupied adjacent space of your choice and don’t land prone.', '17+: You continue to hold on to the creature.']\n\nIf you are knocked prone while climbing or riding a creature, you fall and land prone in an adjacent space of your choice, taking damage as usual from the fall.",
        "JUMP": "When an effect allows you to move, you can long jump a number of squares up to your Might or Agility score (your choice; minimum 1 square) without a test as part of that movement. If you move at least 2 squares in a straight line immediately before your jump, you can long jump 1 additional square.\n\nIf you want to jump even farther than your initial jump allows, make an easy Might test. On a success, you jump 1 additional square, or 2 additional squares if you get a success with a reward.\n\nThe height of your jump is 1 square. If you move at least 2 squares in a straight line immediately before your jump, you can jump 1 square higher.\n\nYou can’t jump farther or higher than the distance of the effect that allows you to move.",
        "CRAWL": "If you are prone (see Conditions), you can remain prone and crawl on the ground. Doing so costs you 1 additional square of movement for every square you crawl. If you intentionally want to crawl, you can fall prone as a free maneuver on your turn. While voluntarily prone, you can choose to stand as a free maneuver.",
        "FLY": "A creature who can fly can move through the air vertically or horizontally at full speed. Such creatures can also hover in midair. If a flying creature is knocked prone or has their speed reduced to 0, they fall (see Falling).",
        "TELEPORT": "When you teleport, you move from one space to another space instantaneously. The following rules apply to teleporting:\n\n['Teleporting doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.', 'When you teleport, you bypass any obstacles between the space you leave and your destination space.', 'The creature teleporting you must have line of effect from the space you leave and to your destination space.', 'Your destination space can’t be occupied by another creature or object.', 'You don’t spend your movement when you teleport. Instead, the effect that lets you teleport tells you how far you can teleport.', 'If you teleport while prone, you can be standing when you reach your destination space provided you are able to stand. If another creature teleports you, it is up to them if you remain prone or stand, provided you are able.', 'If you teleport while affected by the grabbed or restrained conditions, those conditions end for you.']"
      },
      "DIFFICULT TERRAIN": "Areas of thick underbrush, rubble, spiderwebs, or other obstacles to movement create difficult terrain. It costs 1 additional square of movement to enter a square of difficult terrain.",
      "HIGH GROUND": "When you make an attack against a creature or object and you occupy a space that is fully above the space the target takes up, with the bottom of your space higher than the top of the target’s space, you gain an edge on the power roll against that target.",
      "FORCED MOVEMENT": {
        "VERTICAL": "If a forced movement effect has the word “vertical” in front of it, then the forced movement can move a target up or down in addition to horizontally. For example, if a forced movement effect says “vertical push 5,” then the creature targeted by the effect can be pushed up to 5 squares in any direction, as long as the forced movement is a straight line.\n\nIf a creature who can’t fly is left in midair at the end of a vertical forced move, they fall.\n\nThough you can’t push, pull, or slide a creature unless that forced movement specifies “vertical,” you can move them along a slope. For a creature to be force moved along a slope, each square of the slope can be no more than 1 square higher or lower than the previous square.",
        "SLAMMING INTO CREATURES": "When you force move a creature into another creature, the movement ends and both creatures take 1 damage for each square remaining in the first creature’s forced movement. You can also force move an object into a creature. The object’s movement ends and the creature takes 1 damage for each square remaining in the object’s forced movement.\n\nIt is possible to move a creature or object of a larger size into several creatures of a smaller size at the same time. When this happens, all creatures in the collision take damage once.\n\nIf a creature is killed by damage from an attack or effect that force moves them, the second creature still takes damage unless the Director deems otherwise.\n\nYou can force move another creature into yourself with a pull or a slide.",
        "TRACKING OBJECT FORCED-MOVEMENT DAMAGE": "['At the Director’s discretion, mundane objects that are force moved into creatures or other objects take damage as if they were creatures. Sturdy objects can take damage as follows:', ['For each square a wood object occupies, it can take 3 damage before it is destroyed.', 'For each square a stone object occupies, it can take 6 damage before it is destroyed.', 'For each square a metal object occupies, it can take 9 damage before it is destroyed.'], 'More fragile objects are destroyed after taking any damage.']",
        "SLAMMING INTO OBJECTS": "When you force move a creature into a stationary object that is their size or larger and the object doesn’t break (see below), the movement ends and the creature takes 1 damage for each square remaining in their forced movement.\n\nIf you force move a creature downward into an object that doesn’t break (including the ground), they also take falling damage.",
        "HURLING THROUGH OBJECTS": "When you move a creature into a mundane object, the object can break depending on how many squares of forced movement remain:\n\n['It costs 1 remaining square of forced movement to destroy 1 square of glass. The creature moved takes 1 damage.', 'It costs 3 remaining squares of forced movement to destroy 1 square of wood. The creature moved takes 3 damage.', 'It costs 6 remaining squares of forced movement to destroy 1 square of stone. The creature moved takes 6 damage.', 'It costs 9 remaining squares of forced movement to destroy 1 square of metal. The creature moved takes 9 damage.']\n\nIf any forced movement remains after the object is destroyed, you can continue to move the creature who destroyed the object.",
        "FORCED INTO A FALL": "If you can’t fly and are force moved across an open space that would cause you to fall, such as being pushed over the edge of a cliff, you continue moving the total distance you were moved first. If you are still in a position to fall when your move ends, you fall.",
        "FOR THE DIRECTOR: USE TACTICAL MAPS": "['This is a tactical game. To get the most out of the rules for movement, difficult terrain, and falling, you should use encounter maps with interesting environmental features. You might have ledges, pits of acid, walls of fire, mechanical traps, columns, giant webs, magical hazards, and the like for creatures to be thrown into, thrown off of, or thrown through. You’ll want most of your battles to take place in environments with plenty of space to move around, avoiding a lot of long corridors that are 1 square wide.']",
        "STABILITY": "Each creature has a stability that allows them to resist forced movement. When a creature is forced moved, they can reduce the movement up to a number of squares equal to their stability. Heroes start with a stability of 0 that can be increased through kit and ancestry options."

      "MAKE OR ASSIST A TEST": "Many tests are maneuvers if made in combat. Searching a chest with a Reason test, picking a door’s lock with an Agility test, or lifting a portcullis with a Might test would all be maneuvers. Assisting a test is also a maneuver in combat.\n\nComplex or time-consuming tests might require an action if made in combat—or could take so long that they can’t be made during combat at all. Other tests that take no time at all, such as a Reason test to recall lore about mummies, are usually free maneuvers in combat.

Most of the time, you’ll want to use the more impactful actions found on your character sheet, just as the director will use the actions in a creature’s stat block, but free strikes are always available for when all else fails. For instance, a fury who has no other options for ranged attacks might use the Ranged Weapon Free Strike attack with an improvised weapon when battling a flying creature.",
      "HEAL": "You use your action to employ medicine or inspiring words to make an adjacent creature feel better and stay in the fight. The creature can spend a Recovery to regain Stamina, or can make a resistance roll against a “(resistance ends)” effect they are suffering."
    },
    "FREE STRIKES": {
      "OPPORTUNITY ATTACKS": "Whenever a creature within the reach of your melee free strike moves out of it without shifting, you can take advantage of their movement to quickly make a melee free strike against them as a free triggered action. This is called an opportunity attack.\n\nIf you have a bane or double bane on the power roll against the creature, you can’t make the free strike.",
      "STANDARD FREE STRIKES": {
        "MELEE WEAPON FREE STRIKE": [
          "Keywords: Attack, Melee, Weapon",
          "Type: Action",
          "Distance: Reach 1",
          "Target: 1 creature or object"
        ],

          "Target: 1 creature or object"
        ]
      }
    },
    "FLANKING": "When you and at least one ally are adjacent to the same enemy and on completely opposite sides of the enemy, you are flanking that enemy. While flanking an enemy, you gain an edge on melee attacks against them.\n\nIf you’re unsure whether your hero and an ally are flanking a foe, imagine a line extending from the center of your space to your ally’s space. If that line passes through opposite sides or corners of the enemy’s space, then you and your ally are flanking the enemy.\n\nYou must have line of effect to the enemy and be able to take triggered actions in order to gain or grant the flanking benefit.",
    "COVER": "When you have line of effect to a creature or object but that target has at least half their form blocked by a solid obstruction such as a tree, wall, or overturned table, the target has cover. You take a bane on attacks and area abilities that deal damage against creatures or objects that have cover from you.",
    "CONCEALMENT": {
      "INVISIBLE CREATURES": "Invisible creatures always have concealment from other creatures. If an invisible creature isn’t hidden, they can still be targeted with abilities, though attacks against them take a bane. The test made to find a hidden creature who is invisible takes a bane."
    },
    "DAMAGE": {
      "DAMAGE TYPES": {
        "DAMAGE IMMUNITY": "Damage immunity means that a creature can ignore some or all of the damage they would usually take from certain attacks or effects.\n\nDamage immunity might have a damage type associated with it, expressed as “[damage type] immunity.” Alternatively, damage immunity might apply to any powers that deal damage with the Weapon, Magic, or Psionic keyword. Damage immunity of either kind often has a value associated with it, so that one creature’s stat block notes “fire immunity 5,” while another creature has “Magic immunity 5.”\n\nWhenever a target with damage immunity takes damage of the indicated type or from a power with the indicated keyword, they reduce the damage by the value of the immunity (to a minimum of 0 damage). If the value of the immunity is “all,” then the target takes no damage of the indicated type or from those powers.\n\nCertain creatures also have forced move damage immunity. Whenever they take damage from forced movement, that damage is reduced by a number equal to their immunity.\n\nDamage immunity should be the last thing applied when calculating damage. For instance, if your hero has Weapon immunity 5 and takes 8 damage from a weapon attack, you would take 3 damage. If a tactician first halved the damage you take with the Parry triggered action, you would take 4 damage from the attack before immunity is applied, with immunity then reducing the damage to 0.\n\nIf multiple damage immunities apply to a source of damage, only the immunity with the highest value applies.",
        "DAMAGE WEAKNESS": "Damage weakness works like damage immunity, except that creatures take extra damage whenever they take damage of the indicated type, or from a source with the indicated keyword. For instance, if a creature has fire weakness 5 and is dealt 10 fire damage, they take 15 fire damage instead.\n\nA creature who has “damage weakness X” with no specific type or keyword indicated has weakness of the indicated amount when they take damage of any type.\n\nIf you have both damage immunity and weakness applied to a source of damage, apply both. First apply weakness, then immunities."
      }
    },
    "STAMINA": {
      "RECOVERIES AND RECOVERY VALUE": "Each hero has a number of Recoveries determined by their class. A hero also has a recovery value that equals one-third of their Stamina, rounded down. When you use the Catch Breath action (see Actions), you spend a Recovery and regain Stamina equal to your recovery value. Outside of combat, you can spend as many Recoveries as you have remaining. Some abilities, items, and other effects allow you to spend a Recovery to regain Stamina equal to your recovery value plus a little extra (as described by the effect), or to regain Stamina without spending a Recovery.",
      "WINDED": "Your winded value equals half your Stamina maximum. When your Stamina is equal to or less than your winded value, you are winded. Although being winded has no effects on its own, certain ancestry, class, item, and title abilities affect winded creatures.\n\nYou can tell when other creatures are winded and vice versa.",
      "DYING AND DEATH": "When your Stamina is 0 or lower, you are dying. While dying, you can’t take the Catch Breath action in combat, and whenever you make a test using Might or Agility, make an attack, or use an action, maneuver, or a triggered action, you lose 1d6 Stamina after the action, maneuver, or triggered action is resolved. This Stamina loss can’t be prevented in any way. While you are dying, your allies can help you spend recoveries in combat, and you can spend Recoveries out of combat as usual.\n\nWhile your Stamina is lower than 0, if it reaches the negative of your winded value, you die. When you die, you can’t be brought back to life without the use of a special powerful item such as a Scroll of Resurrection.",
      "DIRECTOR-CONTROLLED CREATURES": {
        "NO RECOVERIES": "Director-controlled creatures don’t have Recoveries or a recovery value. Any such creatures who regain Stamina during a battle do so via a special item or an ability in their stat block. However, there are times when a hero might wish to use an ability that allows another creature to spend a Recovery or to regain Stamina equal to their recovery value on an injured NPC. In such cases, a Director-controlled creature regains Stamina equal to one-third their Stamina maximum."
      },
      "KNOCKING CREATURES OUT": {
        "UNCONSCIOUS": "While you are unconscious, you can’t take actions, maneuvers, triggered actions, free triggered actions, or free maneuvers; your speed is 0; you are unaware of your surroundings; and you are prone. Attacks against you have a double edge. If you wake up from being unconscious, you can stand up from prone as a free maneuver."
      },
      "TEMPORARY STAMINA": "Some abilities, treasures, and other effects grant a creature temporary Stamina. Temporary Stamina shouldn’t be included in a creature’s Stamina total when figuring out a creature’s recovery value or winded value. If you have temporary Stamina while winded, dying, or dead, the temporary Stamina doesn’t change those states.\n\nWhenever you take damage while you have temporary Stamina, the temporary Stamina decreases first, and any leftover damage is applied to your Stamina as usual. For instance, if you have 10 temporary Stamina and take 16 damage, you lose the temporary Stamina and then lose another 6 Stamina.\n\nThere is no maximum to how much temporary Stamina you can have. Regaining Stamina can’t restore temporary Stamina. If you have temporary Stamina and then gain more temporary Stamina, you get whichever amount of temporary Stamina is greater, rather than adding the two pools together. For instance, if an ability grants you 10 temporary Stamina when you already have 5, you have 10 temporary Stamina, not 15.\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, temporary Stamina disappears when you finish a Respite.",
      "OBJECT STAMINA": "Mundane objects in the game have Stamina based on the material they’re made of. When an object’s Stamina is reduced to 0, the object is destroyed. Objects have damage immunity to all poison and psychic damage. Objects made of common materials have Stamina as follows:\n\n['A size 1 object or 1 square of a larger object made of glass has 1 Stamina.', 'A size 1 object or 1 square of a larger object made of wood has 3 Stamina.', 'A size 1 object or 1 square of a larger object made of stone has 6 Stamina.', 'A size 1 object or 1 square of a larger object made of metal has 9 Stamina.']\n\nThe Director can decide that a well-made or poorly made object has more or less Stamina. Destroying a supernatural object often (but not always) requires a specific quest, such as throwing a magic ring back into the volcano where it was forged."
    },
    "UNDERWATER COMBAT": "If a creature is fully submerged in water, they have fire immunity 5 and lightning weakness 5. If their speed doesn’t have the Swim keyword, all their power rolls take a bane.",
    "MOUNTED COMBAT": "A willing allied creature with the Mount role (see Creature Roles in the Bestiary) can serve as your mount as long as their size is greater than yours. You can climb onto your mount freely (see Climbing Other Creatures). You can then use your maneuver on your turn to allow your mount to take a move action instead of you. The mount can benefit from this extra move action only once per round.\n\nIf a creature riding a mount is force moved, they are knocked off the mount, and must make a test to determine how they land (see Climbing Other Creatures). If a mount is force moved, they carry any riders with them.",
    "END OF COMBAT": {
      "HOW COMBAT ENDS": {
        "FLEEING FOES": "['If you’ve played an RPG like this one before, odds are you’ve had an encounter where you didn’t chase down every last fleeing foe—and then one such foe grabbed another bunch of evil buddies and came back to ambush you. It takes only one experience like this to create players who promise, “No survivors. No mercy!” whenever foes break ranks. Chasing down every last foe can be fun once in a while, but it can easily turn a tactical encounter into a slog.', 'Luckily, this is a heroic game. Although the Director can surprise the players with dramatic reveals and twisty-turny stories, “Gotcha!” moments that make players suspicious of every fleeing bandit shouldn’t be part of those stories. If a bandit is fleeing an encounter, they’re running away to rethink their life. If they’re going for help, the players should get some sense of that—for example, the bandit screaming at the top of their lungs as they run toward their leader’s tent. That way, the players can process what’s happening, and will understand that stopping that fleeing bandit is part of the challenge of the encounter.']"
      },
      "OBJECTIVE ENDINGS": {
        "DIMINISH NUMBERS": "Sometimes the heroes simply defeat enough of their enemies that the rest don’t stand a chance. For example, the Director might decide that an encounter ends when the heroes have no non-minion enemies remaining, when the heroes outnumber their foes, or when the number of remaining enemies is half of what it was at the start of the encounter.\n\nThe Director can also use the following guideline to determine when it’s time to call “Cut!” if one of the encounter’s objectives is for the heroes to diminish their foes. At the end of a round of combat with no living solo or boss creatures (see the Bestiary), the Director should add up the levels of all the enemies who oppose the heroes. Minions count as 1/5 of their listed level for this purpose. Then the Director adds the levels of all the remaining heroes who aren’t dying together. If the combined level of the heroes is twice or more than the combined level of their enemies, the Director should end combat.",
        "DEFEAT SPECIFIC FOE": "A combat encounter might include one or more of the heroes’ enemies commanding the rest, such as a hobgoblin captain leading a group of mercenaries, or one or more particularly powerful foes among a group of weaker ones, such as a pair of tusker demons in a gnoll war band. Because these enemies are the stars of the encounter, if only weak foes are left once the stars are gone, the battle loses its challenge and it’s time to wrap it up. Under such circumstances, the Director can end the combat once those special creatures are defeated.",
        "GET THE THING!": "Classic heroic fantasy is full of important objects that the heroes must protect from the forces of evil: magic rings, royal birth certificates, dragon eggs, and the like. Heroes often find themselves at violent odds with their enemies as they race to collect a valuable or important item from a guarded temple or castle, or when they need to steal the item from a group of enemies already in possession of it.\n\nObjectives in this category work well when paired with other objectives. For instance, the heroes must steal a ledger containing a record of criminal activity from an overmind and her lackeys. However, even if they obtain the ledger, the battle won’t be over until they also defeat the overmind, who won’t let the book go without a fight!",
        "DESTROY THE THING!": "Combat doesn’t always have to be about destroying your enemies. Sometimes it’s about destroying their stuff! Burning a pirate captain’s vessel, closing a portal to the Abyssal Wasteland before it lets in an army of demons, or shutting down a massive kobold trap made of spinning blades could so hamper the heroes’ foes that the battle is no longer worth fighting once the damage is done.",
        "SAVE ANOTHER": "No one earns the mantle of hero without saving a few lives. If the heroes rescue a powerful ally from the clutches of their foes during combat, the added strength of that ally might be enough to make the remainder of the encounter trivial. When you and your allies save a griffon from a crew of poachers, the hunters become the… well, you know the rest.",
        "HOLD THEM OFF": "Sometimes the heroes just need to buy time. They might need to battle a conquering tyrant’s army to allow innocent villagers time to escape. They might need to hold off wave after wave of zombies while a group of priests completes a ritual to lay the undead to rest for good. To achieve this objective, the heroes need to stay alive and protect a particular position for a number of rounds determined by the Director.",
        "STOP THE ACTION": "Sometimes combat is complicated by the fact that the heroes need to stop the villainous actions of their foes. It’s not enough to simply defeat the warriors in a cult. The heroes must also stop the zealots’ archdevil-summoning ritual! Or it might be that the heroes need to interrupt a wedding and make sure an evil mage doesn’t marry the heir to the throne. Despite combat, the mage forces the ceremony to continue!\n\nObjectives in this category often have a timer associated with them. If the heroes don’t achieve the objective in a certain number of rounds, the conditions of the battle should change. For instance, if the cultists summon the archdevil, defeating the devil suddenly becomes the heroes’ new objective!",
        "MAKING OBJECTIVES KNOWN": "['Encounters work best if the players have a good idea of what they are working toward. The Director doesn’t need to state objectives outright to the players at the start of the battle, though they can if they like. Not all groups want to start combat with the Director saying, “Your objectives are to break the eldritch machine and destroy the vampire lord,” because doing so might take the players out of the game’s narrative.', 'In many combat encounters, the objectives are obvious. For instance, in a battle against a necromancer controlling a horde of undead minions, the players probably don’t need to be told that defeating the necromancer ends the encounter when that’s an easy assumption. In an encounter against cultists performing a world-ending ritual, the heroes can guess that stopping the ritual is one of their objectives. In fact, they probably went on this adventure to specifically achieve that objective. They’re not there for karaoke at the end of existence!', 'Not all objectives are so clear, however. In a battle against a goblin cursespitter, a kobold legionary, and three human knaves guarding the entrance to a bandit fortress, it can be difficult to know what the exact objective of the encounter is, beyond “Defeat them all!” The objective could be to simply diminish the enemy forces, but it could also be the case that the cursespitter leads the group, so that defeating the goblin causes the other forces to fall apart. In such a case, it helps if the Director provides at least a hint of that setup at the start of the battle. The cursespitter could clearly issue orders and even call the other bandits cowards, demanding that they not “run away like last time!”']",
        "COMPLETE THE ACTION": "The opposite of “Stop the Action,” this objective ending sees the characters charged with initiating an event, performing a ritual, and so forth. For instance, if the heroes are attempting to launch an airship while repelling a time raider boarding party, the encounter could be over the moment the heroes manage to activate the vessel and take off with just a few time raiders actually aboard.",
        "OBJECTIVES AND ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY": "Objectives can modify an encounter’s difficulty by extending the scope of success beyond grinding every enemy down to 0 Stamina. When the heroes are challenged to defeat specific foes or take other actions while trying not to die, those objectives can make an encounter easier than the encounter rules would usually dictate. As such, the Director should feel free to turn up the heat a bit.\n\n(Playtest note: More specific advice on this topic is to come as the encounter-building system is developed.)"
      },
      "DRAMATIC FINISH": "If the heroes are able to end a fight with a dramatic finish, the Director assigns each hero one or more of their remaining enemies, then asks that hero’s player to describe how the hero neutralizes that enemy. The hero might deliver a killing blow, knock their foe out, or let the enemy flee with their tail between their legs (literally or figuratively). If the fight has more heroes than Director controlled enemies, the Director can assign more than one hero to an enemy, then ask the players how their characters work together to bring that enemy down. After everyone gives a description, the battle ends.",
      "EVENT ENDING": {
        "LAST-STAND STAMINA": "[\"For players who enjoy fighting to the bitter end rather than ending combat early, the Director can use this **optional rule** to bring things to a quicker conclusion. When it's clear that the heroes are going to win a battle, their enemies are overcome with fear, despair, and panic. In this weakened state, each enemy's Stamina drops to 1, and each minion has a damage threshold of 1. The heroes can then swiftly finish off the remaining foes, getting the satisfaction of total annihilation through dice rolls.\"]"
      }
    }
  },
  "NEGOTIATION": {
    "WHEN TO NEGOTIATE": {
      "LIMITS OF NEGOTIATION": "Some players might instinctively feel that the negotiation rules should give them something akin to mind-control superpowers. They’re not used to imagining NPCs complexly, and might attempt to negotiate in situations where negotiation is either completely unreasonable or literally impossible. No matter how persuasive or well spoken a hero is, there’s no argument to be made that might convince the vile Lord Syuul to give up his pursuit of evil and become a gardener. A negotiation typically can’t convince a queen to hand over her crown to the heroes and name them the new rulers of the land, or inspire a dragon to fork over every piece of treasure in their hoard.\n\nNegotiations only work when the heroes ask for something from an NPC that the NPC is willing to seriously consider giving them.\n\n**Negotiation is not a process that changes an NPC’s character.** Rather, the heroes are trying to make an NPC understand how behaving differently would be in character. You might well be able to get the hitherto loyal lieutenant of an evil boss to reconsider the error of their ways. That’s a classic dramatic trope. But even then, you’re not changing their character—you’re convincing them that their current evil ways are out of character. “Is this who you are? Is this how you want to be remembered?!”\n\nIf some players want to use the negotiation system as a means to an end by having their characters say, “Just do what we tell you, or else!,” you can remind them that that’s not how most people, including NPCs, work. Any heroes who open with that attitude are likely to lose the negotiation before it begins.",
      "THE THREAT OF VIOLENCE": "In the real world, negotiations rarely come with a threat of immediate violence. Ambassadors don’t usually get into fistfights. But this is a heroic fantasy RPG, featuring heroes who are armed to the teeth and able to alter reality with their minds. The threat of violence is already implied. Everyone involved knows that the characters could draw steel at any moment.\n\nThe Director typically assumes that the underlying potential for events to turn violent is already factored into every negotiation. However, if the heroes decide to bring that threat to the forefront, then they’ve exited the realm of negotiation and have entered into a different type of relationship—and it’s probably time to determine initiative.\n\nNegotiation is about persuading someone to help you willingly because you’ve convinced them that meeting your objectives is a good idea. Working with you is wise or logical, or might make them look good. A hero can absolutely threaten someone with violence and force them to do what they want, but this is an incredibly temporary state. A threatened NPC isn’t willingly doing what they’ve been asked. They’re doing it on threat of violence, and will comply only while that threat is evident—after which, they’ll likely go back to their previous behavior as soon as they think they can get away with it.",
      "NEWGOTIATION": "['If you’ve never played a game with a dedicated negotiation system like this, you might need to run it once or twice before you master it, similar to learning any new subsystem in an RPG. The new rules you’ll learn are all dedicated to facilitating roleplaying by allowing the heroes to beseech an NPC for aid, and only involve rolling dice when the heroes don’t directly appeal to that NPC’s motivations.']"
    },
    "NEGOTIATION STATS": {
      "INTEREST": "An NPC’s interest represents how eager they are to make a deal with the heroes. Interest is graded on a scale of 0 (no interest) to 5 (the most possible interest). When a negotiation begins, an NPC’s interest is between 1 and 4. If the NPC’s interest goes to 5, they make a final offer and the negotiation ends (see *Keep Going or Stop*, below). If the NPC’s interest drops to 0, they end a negotiation without offering the heroes any deal.\n\nInterest increases and decreases during the negotiation based on the arguments the heroes make.",
      "PATIENCE": {
        "LANGUAGE AND PATIENCE": "If at least one hero negotiating with an NPC speaks the NPC’s native language (not including Caelian), then the NPC’s patience increases by 1 at the start of the negotiation (to a maximum of 5). If three or more heroes negotiating with an NPC speak the NPC’s native language, the NPC’s patience increases by 2 (to a maximum of 5)."
      },
      "FOR THE DIRECTOR: SHARING INTEREST AND PATIENCE": "['It’s up to you as the Director to decide whether to share an NPC’s interest or patience during a negotiation. Sometimes sharing this information can make an encounter more dramatic, with the players watching their progress rise and fall in real-time. Other groups might find negotiation more fun, dramatic, and immersive if those exact numbers are hidden from the players. In playtesting, some groups loved seeing these statistics and some groups didn’t, just as some groups like knowing the Stamina of every creature in a battle and others prefer to keep that information secret. Talk to your group about what they’d prefer.']",
      "MOTIVATIONS": "Each NPC has at least two motivations the heroes can appeal to with their arguments. Arguments that appeal to an NPC’s motivation require an easier power roll to increase the NPC’s interest. Arguments that don’t appeal to a motivation require a more difficult power roll. See *Making Arguments* for more information.\n\nEach motivation can be successfully appealed to only once during a negotiation. To successfully appeal to a motivation, the heroes must use the motivation in an argument without mentioning one of the NPC’s pitfalls or being caught in a lie.",
      "PITFALLS": "Pitfalls are motivations that spark ire, discomfort, shame, fear, or some other negative response in an NPC. Using a pitfall in an argument causes an NPC’s interest and patience to wane. Each NPC has at least one pitfall, and many have two or more.\n\nPitfalls and motivations are two sides of the same concept. They’re presented below as a single list, so that what might be a motivation for one NPC is a pitfall for another. Whenever the heroes make an argument, they risk stumbling into one of an NPC’s pitfalls unless they do their research beforehand or read the NPC well.",
      "LIST OF MOTIVATIONS AND PITFALLS": {
        "BENEVOLENCE": "An NPC with the benevolence motivation believes in sharing what they have with others. However, an NPC involved in a negotiation must be limited in their benevolence, so that they don’t just give the heroes what they need.\n\nSometimes an NPC’s benevolence might extend only to a specific group of people, so that a benevolent pirate captain might share their plunder freely with the rest of their crew—but they’re still plundering! Other times, an NPC’s charity might be limited by the fact that they don’t have much to give. A benevolent NPC might be hesitant to give the heroes help because they believe their limited resources are more necessary or could do more good somewhere else.\n\nAn NPC with the benevolence pitfall has a cynical view of the world, believing that no creature has a right to anything just by being alive. The idea of helping others because it’s the right thing to do is a preposterous, immature, or inexperienced idea to be laughed off or snuffed out.\n\nArguments that appeal to a benevolence motivation contend that if the NPC strikes a deal with the heroes, the people the NPC cares about will benefit from the deal. Example arguments include the following:\n\n['“If you lend us the Sword of Agathor, we can make Capital safer for your guild by using it to lay your enemies low.”', '\"If you can teleport us into the dragon’s cave, we’ll give you half the wyrm’s hoard once we cut off the creature’s head. That could benefit generations of students at your academy!\"']",
        "DISCOVERY": "An NPC with the discovery motivation wants to learn new lore, explore forgotten places, break ground with new experiments, or uncover artifacts lost to time. Their curiosity and quest for knowledge might be driven by a specific goal, such as seeking the cure for a rare disease or a portal to a specific far-off world. Or it could be that they are a naturally inquisitive person who just wants to understand all they can about the timescape.\n\nAn NPC with the discovery pitfall has no interest in finding new places, peoples, or ideas. It might be that the unknown scares them or makes them so uncomfortable that they’d rather remain ignorant. Alternatively, a previous pursuit of discovery might have turned out poorly for them.\n\nArguments that appeal to a discovery motivation contend that striking a deal with the heroes will allow the NPC to gain new knowledge or acquire unique property. Example arguments include the following:\n\n['\"Allow us to use your cipher to translate the only copy of the *Codex Mortis*, and then we’ll let you read the book when we’re done.\"', '\"We know the journey to Decant Isle is dangerous, but we’re going into uncharted territory. We thought that your crew of sailors might want to be among the few mortals to lay eyes on the place.\"']",
        "FREEDOM": "An NPC with the freedom motivation wants no authority above them and desires no authority over others. They might already have personal freedom and wish to maintain that status quo, or they might wish to liberate themself or others from someone else’s authority.\n\nAn NPC with the freedom pitfall believes that a world without authority is one in turmoil and chaos. They might even believe that they are the right person to rule, and that their ideals should be the ones that become the law of the land.\n\nArguments that appeal to a freedom motivation contend that helping the heroes will maintain or grant freedom to the NPC or other people. Example arguments include the following:\n\n['\"I know you want to see the queen’s authority revoked forever. She has no heirs. Give us the key to her study so that we can prove her corruption and give you a chance to topple the monarchy henceforth.\"', '\"If you promise to give us ten vials of Assassin’s Kiss, we’ll see to it that the baron’s prison is emptied.\"']",
        "GREED": "An NPC with the greed motivation desires wealth and resources above almost anything else. Sometimes these NPCs are misers, much like wyrms who hoard coins and gems but never spend or donate them. Others flaunt their wealth, viewing it as a sign of their station in life. Greed-driven NPCs might share their wealth with a select group of people they love, such as a noble lord who indulges his children’s every desire. Some NPCs might be greedy for resources other than money, such as a demon who wants to collect and devour souls, or a troll lord who hungers endlessly for the flesh of others.\n\nAn NPC with the greed pitfall has no interest in accumulating wealth or other resources, and becomes offended if anyone tries to buy their participation. They hold their ideals above material desires.\n\nArguments that appeal to a greed motivation contend that helping the heroes will increase the NPC’s wealth or assets. Example arguments include the following:\n\n['\"You should help us battle the overmind. Xorranox’s wealth is legendary, and we’ll see to it that you get your fair share.\"', '\"Give us a week to do research among your private collection of books, and we’ll give you another ten unique tomes we found in an ancient star elf sanctuary.\"']",
        "HIGHER AUTHORITY": "An NPC with the higher authority motivation remains staunchly loyal to a person or force they perceive as more important than themself. This higher authority could be an organization, a deity or being of great power, a formal leader such as a noble or monarch, a mystical presence or force the NPC might not fully understand, or a person the NPC sees as an informal authority figure (an older sibling, a personal hero, and so forth).\n\nAn NPC with the higher authority pitfall scoffs at the idea of serving another. The NPC might not believe that all people should be free, but they certainly believe that they personally shouldn’t have to answer to anyone.\n\nArguments that appeal to a higher authority motivation contend that it’s in the interest of the higher authority for the NPC to strike a deal with the heroes. A hero might even tell the NPC that if the higher authority were in the NPC’s position, they would take the deal. Example arguments include the following:\n\n['\"All great creations honor your god, Malus. If you teach me to forge the Hammer of Azdul, that will be a great honor to bestow upon your god.\"', '\"You know what Jarith the Bold would do? He’d guide us through the vast wasteland of the desert to reach the tower. Will you be our Jarith?\"']",
        "JUSTICE": "An NPC with the justice motivation wants to see the righteous rewarded and the wicked punished, however subjective their sense of who or what is good and evil. A priest who venerates a god of nature might believe that all who protect plants and animals are righteous, and that those who harvest natural resources as miners and lumberjacks must die. Having a justice motivation doesn’t necessarily make an NPC a kind or charitable person.\n\nAn NPC with the justice pitfall doesn’t believe that the timescape is an inherently just place, and has no interest in making it one. The world is eternal conflict, there is no such thing as justice, and anyone who thinks otherwise is a naive fool.\n\nArguments that appeal to a justice motivation position the heroes on the good side of an NPC’s sense of right and wrong. Example arguments include the following:\n\n['\"You despise those who steal from nature. Allow us peacefully into your wode so we may bottle the Blessed Spring’s water. We’re going to use it to stop an army from felling every tree and tearing up the earth wherever they go.\"', '\"You think nobles are lazy barons who get rich off the backs of peasants. We want to dethrone Lord Saxton. Lend us your crew of thieves, and we’ll see to it that when Saxton falls, the people can choose their own leaders.\"']",
        "LEGACY": "An NPC with the legacy motivation desires fame while alive and acclaim that lasts long after their death. They hope others will know and remember their deeds, great or terrible. Some of these NPCs might even seek immortality through deification or undeath, so that the eventual shedding of their mortal coil doesn’t prevent them from continuing to make history.\n\nAn NPC with a legacy pitfall cares nothing about leaving a personal mark on the world. To them, such vain thinking is nothing but a waste of time.\n\nArguments that appeal to a legacy motivation contend that striking a deal with the heroes increases the likelihood that people will talk about the NPC for centuries to come. Example arguments include the following:\n\n['\"If you give us the vizier’s itinerary, I’ll compose a song about your bravery in defying him, then sing it in every tavern from here to Ix!\"', '\"Yes, losing the battle is a possibility. If we do, the gnolls will still come for you eventually. But if we crush our foes, imagine the honors, the histories, the poems, the statues—all of it created for you because your siege engines turned the tide.\"']",
        "PEACE": "An NPC with the peace motivation wants calm in their life. Under typical circumstances, they want to be left alone to run their business, farm, kingdom, criminal empire, or whatever small slice of the timescape is theirs. Some such NPCs don’t have peace and need help obtaining it, while others want their peaceful status quo to be maintained.\n\nAn NPC with the peace pitfall hates being bored. They want excitement, drama, and danger in their life. For them, there’s nothing worse than the status quo.\n\nArguments that appeal to a peace motivation contend that helping the heroes will earn the NPC some peace, at least for a little while. Example arguments include the following:\n\n['\"You have a good thing going here. A little burgling of nobles, some alcohol smuggling, and some illegal gambling dens. No one’s getting hurt, but Constable Cofax is closing in on you. We could redirect him toward some real danger to the community, if you can help us set a trap for the Watchmaker.\"', '\"I know you don’t sell to outsiders, but we need that helm. I’m going to use it to turn back a group of hobgoblins marching this way. They’re not going to be as friendly as us.\"']",
        "POWER": "An NPC with the power motivation covets the authority of others. They want to increase their influence, no matter how great it already is, and maintain their domain. They might seek power through conquering others, the collection of artifacts, or through the infusion of supernatural rituals—though why choose one method when all three together achieve the best results? Some such NPCs are world-traversing tyrants, but the petty administrators of village organizations and shrines can covet power just as hungrily.\n\nAn NPC with the power pitfall has no interest in authority for themself. They might respect the authority of others, but they hate the thought of ruling over other people and roundly reject any suggestion of the idea.\n\nArguments that appeal to a power motivation contend that working with the heroes will increase or protect the NPC’s power. Example arguments include the following:\n\n['\"Everyone knows you should be running the watch, Percy. The old lady’s retiring, and our friend Baron Kuglar is naming the replacement. Now, you let us into the restricted armory, and we’ll put in a good word.\"', '\"We know he’s your brother, Your Highness, but he’s older—first in line for the throne. If you help us prove he’s in a cult, you become the favorite son.\"']",
        "NPCS CHANGE OVER TIME": "['Just like the heroes, NPCs in negotiations are complex individuals who can change over time. It’s possible that the heroes might have to negotiate with the same NPC for several different favors during the course of a campaign, over which time the NPC’s motivations and pitfalls might change. If the heroes turn a bandit captain with the greed and power motivations into a temporary ally, that criminal might learn from them, changing their ways to rob only those who exploit the poor and giving those earnings to people in need. The next time the heroes negotiate with the bandit captain, they have the benevolence and protection motivations.']",
        "PROTECTION": "An NPC with the protection motivation has land, people, information, items, or an organization they want protected above all else. Keeping their charge safe is a duty they hold dear, and aiding in that protection earns their favor. Most people have friends or family they wish to protect, but an NPC with the protection motivation believes in doing so above all else.\n\nAn NPC with the protection pitfall is happy to leave others to fend for themselves. They don’t believe that it’s their responsibility to protect anyone other than themself, and might be outright disgusted at the thought of risking themself or their property to protect others.\n\nArguments that appeal to a protection motivation contend that helping the heroes allows an NPC to better protect their charge. Example arguments include the following:\n\n['\"Dead soldiers grow the necromancer’s ranks. Total annihilation is the only way to defeat her. March with us now, while her army is small, and we’ll defeat her. Or...\"']",
        "REVELRY": "An NPC with the revelry motivation just wants to have fun. They enjoy socializing at parties, thrill-seeking, or indulging in other hedonistic activities. Getting pleasure out of life while spending time with people they like is paramount to such NPCs.\n\nAn NPC with the revelry pitfall sees social encounters and hedonism as a waste of time. They take pleasure only in work or in building their own skills and character. Others who suggest immature debauchery are not worth their time.\n\nArguments that appeal to the revelry motivation contend that striking a deal with the heroes will allow the NPC to get back to reveling sooner, longer, or harder. Example arguments include the following:\n\n['\"How would you like to have the most exclusive songs for your exclusive birthday celebration next week? I’ll write you a whole original set list, free of charge … provided you extend me and my band here an invitation.\"', '\"I know you don’t want to forge five Chronokinesis Crowns. How’s this instead? You do that for me, and I’ll give you the fourteen kegs of whiskey we found in a steel-dwarf ruin. This stuff is old, unique, and forget-your-first-name potent. You can crack a keg with your friends to celebrate a job well done.\"']",
        "VENGEANCE": "An NPC with the vengeance motivation wants to harm another who has hurt them. Their desire for revenge could be proportional to the harm that was inflicted upon them, or they might wish to pay back their pain with interest. In some cases, a desire for vengeance can be satisfied only by the death of another, but an NPC might wish to pay back their own suffering with embarrassment, career failure, or some other less permanent pain.\n\nAn NPC with the vengeance pitfall believes that revenge solves nothing. They might have gained this belief firsthand, or they might simply not have the ambition to seek revenge—and they take a dim view of others who do.\n\nArguments that appeal to the vengeance motivation contend that the NPC can gain payback for their pain by helping the heroes. Example arguments include the following:\n\n['\"The servants of Ajax killed your sister as she scoured the city for his cults. The Black Iron Pact works for the Overlord. Give us her diaries, and we might uncover the pact’s hideaway and deal a great blow to your hated foes.\"', '\"That prankster Huckable made your trousers tear at the last council meeting. Don’t you want to pay him back? We can arrange a delicious prank at the next gathering, but we need you to guarantee the safety of the orc refugees.\"']"

    "OPENING A NEGOTIATION": {
      "STOP COMBAT, START NEGOTIATION": "If a hero wants to halt hostilities to negotiate with the other side, they can use a maneuver to make a hard Presence test (or another applicable test, as the Director determines) in an attempt to stop combat and start a negotiation. The test has a chance of success only if the Director believes the other side is willing and capable of negotiating. A foe who has the upper hand, who hates the heroes beyond measure, or who lacks sapience is unlikely to negotiate.",

    "UNCOVERING MOTIVATIONS": {
      "OUTSIDE OF NEGOTIATION": "While the heroes can discover an NPC’s motivations or pitfalls through tests made during negotiation, they can employ other methods of investigating motivations or pitfalls before negotiation. Research or a little reconnaissance (for instance, reading the NPC’s diary or talking to their closest friends), can reveal quite a bit about a person!"
    },
    "MAKING ARGUMENTS": {
      "APPEAL TO MOTIVATION": "If an argument doesn’t include a pitfall and appeals to one of the NPC’s motivations that hasn’t already been appealed to, the hero making the argument can make an easy test to attempt to sway the NPC with the argument. Depending on the argument, this can be a Reason, Intuition, or Presence test using any applicable skill—most commonly a skill from the interpersonal skill group. The test has the following outcomes:\n\n**Power Roll + Reason, Intuition, or Presence:**\n\n['11 or lower: The NPC’s patience decreases by 1.', '12–16: The NPC’s interest increases by 1, and their patience decreases by 1.', '17+: The NPC’s interest increases by 1, and their patience doesn’t change.']\n\nAt the Director’s discretion, a particularly well-roleplayed or well-reasoned argument automatically counts as a tier 3 result without a test. Good roleplaying should be rewarded!\n\nIf the heroes attempt to appeal to a motivation that’s already been appealed to, the NPC’s interest remains the same and their patience decreases by 1.",
      "NO MOTIVATION OR PITFALL": "If an argument doesn’t include one of the NPC’s motivations or pitfalls, the hero who makes the argument must make a more difficult test to appeal to the NPC. The test has the following outcomes:\n\n**Power Roll + Reason, Intuition, or Presence:**\n\n['11 or lower: The NPC’s patience decreases by 1, and their interest decreases by 1.', '12–16: The NPC’s patience decreases by 1.', '17+: The NPC’s interest increases by 1, and their patience decreases by 1. (On a natural 19 or 20, the NPC’s patience remains the same.)']\n\nIf the heroes try to use the same argument without a pitfall or motivation twice, the test automatically gets a tier 1 result.",
      "EVERYONE CAN PARTICIPATE": "['Since Reason and Intuition with creatively applied skills can be used to make arguments, all heroes can actively participate in the process of negotiation. The hero with the highest Presence who has the Persuade skill doesn’t automatically have to be the one who makes all the tests.']",
      "CAUGHT IN A LIE": "If a hero lies to an NPC with an argument that fails to increase the NPC’s interest, the Director can decide that the NPC catches the lie and is offended by it. The NPC’s interest decreases by 1, in addition to any decrease imposed by the failure.",
      "PITFALL USED": "If an argument uses one of the NPC’s pitfalls, it automatically fails and the NPC’s interest and patience each decrease by 1. The NPC might also warn the heroes not to treat them in such a way again.",

        "FAME OR INFAMY?": "If a hero has enough Renown to influence an NPC during negotiation, the Director decides if they are famous or infamous to the NPC. If the NPC appreciates a character’s deeds and views them as a hero who makes the world a better place, that hero is famous to them. If the NPC believes the hero’s accomplishments make the world worse and views them as an enemy, the hero is infamous to the NPC.",
        "INFLUENCING TESTS": "If a hero is famous to an NPC, they gain an edge on tests when making arguments to which the Flirt, Lead, or Persuade skill could be applied. If they are infamous to the NPC, they gain an edge on tests when making arguments to which the Brag, Interrogate, or Intimidate skill could be applied. A hero gains this edge even if they don’t have the appropriate skill."
      }
    },
    "NPC RESPONSE AND OFFER": {
      "FOR THE DIRECTOR: REASONS FOR DECEPTION": "['Under certain circumstances, an NPC might not want to show the heroes how well their arguments are working. For example, if an NPC’s interest has dropped so low that they now intend to harm the heroes, the NPC might falsely agree to what the heroes ask for as part of a trap. Likewise, a greedy NPC might try to keep their enthusiasm for a deal concealed while their interest is high to obtain more money or favors from the heroes. If a hero thinks an NPC is attempting to fool them, they can make an Intuition test. On a success, the hero learns their true standing with the NPC.']",
      "INTEREST 5 (“YES, AND …”)": "If the NPC’s interest is 5, they offer everything the heroes initially asked for—and then sweeten the deal. This result is the best possible outcome for the heroes. If they offered to perform any services or make payments as part of the deal, the NPC might waive those obligations, allowing the heroes to get what they want for free. Alternatively, the NPC might hold the heroes to any offers they made and instead offer an extra service or item on top of what was asked for.\n\nFor example, if the heroes asked the boss of a thieves guild for that organization’s help in standing against Lord Saxton, the guildmaster might pledge to send a unit of elite assassins to aid in the battle against that tyrannical noble, and then offer the heroes a quiver filled with explosive arrows to give them an additional advantage in the fight.\n\nThe NPC should let the heroes know that this is the best offer they can make.",
      "INTEREST 4 (\"YES.\")": "If the NPC’s interest is 4, they offer the heroes everything they asked for but won’t sweeten the deal. The NPC also accepts anything the heroes have offered as part of the deal with this result.\n\nFor example, if the heroes offered to help spring a guild thief from prison in exchange for the thieves guild’s elite assassins standing against Lord Saxton, the guildmaster agrees to those terms without attempting to adjust anything. This likely ends the negotiation, but it’s possible that the heroes could push for a little more, provided the NPC has the patience for another argument. A Director could prompt the heroes to push for more by having the NPC ask a leading question, such as, “Is there anything else?” or “What else do you want from me?”",
      "INTEREST 3 (\"YES, BUT …\")": "If the NPC’s interest is 3, they offer the heroes what they want in exchange for everything the heroes offered … then they ask for a little extra, such as a favor or a payment from the characters. If the heroes offered to free a thieves guild member from prison in exchange for the service of the organization’s assassins, the guildmaster might ask them to free an additional prisoner, or to grant the prisoner they rescue a sum of cash or a magic weapon.",
      "INTEREST 2 (\"NO, BUT …\")": "If the NPC’s interest is 2, the NPC can’t give the heroes what they want. However, they are willing to offer other less impactful goods or services in exchange for whatever the heroes have promised. The guildmaster might not be willing to spare any troops to fight Lord Saxton, but could instead offer the latest spy reports on Saxton’s movements in exchange for the jailbreak.",
      "INTEREST 1 (\"NO.\")": "If the NPC’s interest is 1, they outright reject the heroes’ idea without a counteroffer. If the NPC still has patience, they might press the heroes for a better deal, saying something like, “Why should we risk our necks to help you fight Lord Saxton? What’s really in it for the thieves guild, other than a short, brutal end when you inevitably fail?”",
      "INTEREST 0 (\"NO, AND …\")": "If an NPC’s interest is 0, they offer nothing, refuse to negotiate further, and seek to harm the heroes. The NPC might attack immediately, or they could take a different approach, perhaps spreading malicious rumors about the characters, sending assassins after them, or otherwise making their lives difficult. If the heroes don’t want to be at odds with the NPC, they’ll need to offer an valuable gift or undertake a quest just to make amends.\n\nIt is impossible to continue a negotiation when an NPC’s interest drops to 0.",
      "FOR THE DIRECTOR: CREATING RESPONSES AND OFFERS": "['When you’re preparing a negotiation, think of at least two specific asks that the NPC could make of the heroes. Then you’re prepared if the heroes ask what they can do for the NPC and you want to give a response, or if the NPC’s interest becomes 3.', 'These asks could be specific items the heroes have or can obtain (such as a magic sword or psionic crystal), or they might be favors in the form of adventuring (such as slaying a dragon or rescuing a village from a siege).', 'You should also have at least two specific ways the NPC can help the heroes beyond what they’re asking for. These can be used if the NPC’s interest becomes 2, to give the heroes something that can help them that isn’t what they asked for. They can also be used if the NPC’s interest rises to 5, to give the heroes something extra in addition to what they asked for. This help could take the form of treasures or the assistance of a companion or retainer. It might be hidden information that the heroes don’t yet know, and which can help them with their overall goal. Or perhaps it’s a less impactful version of what the heroes initially asked for. If the heroes ask an ancient dragon for help storming a castle, the dragon might offer the services of their younger, less powerful offspring instead of their own assistance … or in addition to it!']"
    },
    "KEEP GOING OR STOP": "If an NPC still has patience after making an offer and their interest is between 1 and 4, the heroes can make another argument to attempt to improve the deal. Alternatively, they can accept the offer and end the negotiation. Let the players drive this decision. You can always have an NPC show they have patience remaining by asking, “Is there anything else?”\n\nIf the NPC’s patience is 0 or their interest is 5, then the offer the NPC makes is their final offer to the characters. The heroes can accept the offer or not, but either way, the negotiation ends.\n\nIf the NPC’s interest is 0, the NPC ends the negotiation without accepting a deal.\n\nThe heroes can walk away from a negotiation without accepting a deal at any time.",
    "SAMPLE NEGOTIATION": {
      "ZOLA’S NEGOTIATION STATS": "Zola is neutral toward the heroes when the negotiation begins. She knows them only by reputation, though she understands that they too believe Saxton is a tyrant who must be stopped. However, standing up to that tyrant has cost her people dearly, and she’s not sure she’s ready to rejoin the fight. One wrong move could spell the end of the Clock!\n\n**ZOLA HONEYCUT NEGOTIATION STATS:**\n\n['**Interest:** 2', '**Patience:** 3', '**Impression:** 3']\n\n**Motivations**\n\n['**Benevolence:** Zola’s name, Honeycut, comes from the fact that she always gives her fellow thieves a bigger cut than her own on jobs.', '**Protection:** The members of the Clock are the only family Zola’s ever known. The guild’s motto is “The Clock is always ticking,” because they’re always planning the next job and their ever-richer future. Zola doesn’t want to be the guild’s last master.']\n\n**Pitfalls**\n\n['**Higher Authority:** Zola has no interest in serving anyone other than herself, and she scoffs at the suggestion of taking orders.', '**Revelry:** Zola is all business and has no time for frivolity, especially while living under Saxton’s threat.']",
      "ROLEPLAYING ZOLA": "Zola is glad that people are finally opposing Lord Saxton, but is angry that no one rose up with the Clock months ago when the tyrant first staged his coup. She’s passionate about protecting her people, quick to call out dangerous plans in arguments she doesn’t like, and fast to praise statements she agrees with. She’s not afraid to speak her mind to the heroes, knowing that they share her desire to see Saxton gone. She’s just not sure she can risk more of her found family in the current fight.",
      "NEGOTIATION IN ACTION": "Here’s how the negotiation with Zola might play out. In this scenario, Alyssa is playing Jorn the tactician, Grace is playing Val the conduit, James is playing Korvo the shadow, and Matt is playing Linn the talent. All the heroes have a Renown of 2 except for Jorn, who has a Renown of 3 and is therefore famous to Zola.\n\n**Director:** The windows are boarded up, allowing no light to enter the seemingly abandoned Goat’s Eye tavern. The whole place smells of charred wood, evidence of the fire that burned most of the building’s interior three years ago. As the door shuts behind you, light from a hooded lantern on the opposite side of the tavern suddenly fills the room. Amid the blackened walls and pillars, you see that six burly ruffians flank your group on both sides. The human holding the lantern smiles. “Welcome. I’m Zola. Willoughby told me you were coming. Have a seat.” She motions to a few crates arranged in a circle around a wide barrel.\n\n**James (playing Korvo):** I have a seat and say, “Korvo at your service, Ms. Honeycut. And these here are the finest companions a polder could ask for: Linn, Jorn, and Val.”\n\n**Director:** Zola nods to each of you in turn, then says, “You’ll excuse me if I dispense with more pleasantries. These days, no place is safe for the Clock. We keep moving. So tell me, what are you here for?”\n\n**Alyssa (playing Jorn):** “We’re building an army to take down Saxton once and for all.”\n\n**Director:** Zola gives a mirthless chuckle as she shakes her head. “Oh is that all? I have to tell you, I don’t think the four of you stand much of a chance. Unless you’re hiding a legion or two of dwarves in your pockets. Yes, you have Jorn the Mighty with you, but you’ll need more than one famous warrior to win the day.”\n\n**Alyssa:** Ah! So she has heard of me at least! Thanks, Renown.\n\n**Grace (playing Val):** “We don’t. But we do have Lord Edmund—the true heir to the Bedegar throne.”\n\n**Director:** Zola nods, impressed. “I’m glad the boy is safe, but that’s all he is—a boy, not an army.”\n\n**Matt (playing Linn):** “He’s a boy people will rally around. We have no army, but that’s why we’re here. We’re planning on changing that. Can you spare any soldiers for our cause?”\n\nThe negotiation officially starts. The heroes have stated what they want from Zola. The Director begins by prompting them to make an argument.\n\n**Director:** Zola leans back on her crate. “There it is. The Clock has sacrificed much against Saxton. Why should we risk more to help? No one was here to help us months ago when we stood up to tyranny.”\n\n**Alyssa:** I nod along as Zola speaks, listening before I say, “We didn’t hear of your struggle until after Saxton had already hanged many of your brave people. We’re here now. How can we help?”\n\nBefore making an argument, Jorn is attempting to learn what Zola’s motivations are by simply asking. The Director decides to reveal one of Zola’s motivations: protection.\n\n**Director:** “If I were to make a deal with you, and that’s a big ‘if,’ I’d need assurances that you can end this. Proof would be even better. The protection of my people is my top priority. We can earn freedom from Saxton once we regain our strength.”\n\n**James:** Aha! I got this, folks. I stand atop my crate and say, “Well, we can surely offer that, Ms. Honeycut. We have convinced Lord Edmund to grant amnesty to any who swear to serve him.” I’d like to roll a Presence test to convince her.\n\n**Director:** Hold it there, champ. Zola’s eyes narrow as you speak, and she holds up a hand to cut you off. “I will not swear to serve any ruler, no matter how benevolent. I’ll consider being a partner, but even that outlook is grim if you tell me again that I need to bend the knee.”\n\nKorvo inadvertently made an argument using a pitfall by appealing to a higher authority. The Director notes that Zola’s interest drops to 1 and her patience drops to 2. Zola gave a pretty firm “No” response here, which is what an NPC with an interest of 1 would say. However, the Director phrased Zola’s response in such a way that the heroes know they can keep making arguments if they wish, since her patience hasn’t run out.\n\n**James:** Sorry! I thought that’d work. Seems like higher authority is a pitfall for her.\n\n**Grace:** Let’s try to avoid any others. Val says, “We’re sorry, Zola. We don’t want to do anything else to offend you.” I’d like to make an Intuition test and use my Read Person skill to gauge her reaction to see if I can discern any other pitfalls.\n\n**Director:** Cool. Hard difficulty.\n\n**Grace:** I got a 17! Success.\n\n**Director:** Zola sits back, chuckling. “There’s two things I can’t stand—anyone telling me to kiss a ring and merry fools who would rather go drinking than fight for their freedom. Luckily, you’re not the latter.” You can tell that revelry also won’t go over well with Zola.\n\nThe heroes now know both of Zola’s pitfalls: higher authority and revelry.\n\n**Linn:** Linn is going to say, “We’re recruiting more than just the Clock. We have a good chance of recruiting the elves of the wode and the orcs of Forest Rend, and we’re already training the people of Gravesford to put up a fight. If we strike before Saxton can fully build his forces, we all stand a better chance of survival. If you don’t stand with us, Saxton will still come for you. He’s already coming for you. The Clock stands less of a chance alone.”\n\n**Director:** I think that’s a Reason test, since you’re using logic to point out that you have a better chance together than on your own. It’s easy too, since you’re appealing to one of her motivations.\n\n**Linn:** Great! Can I use Lead here, since I’m demonstrating our ability to bring people together?\n\n**Director:** I’ll allow it.\n\n**Linn:** That’s a 14!\n\nBecause Linn appealed to a motivation, Zola’s interest increases to 2, and her patience remains at 2. The Director gives a “No, but …” response based on Zola’s interest. At this point, the heroes haven’t promised anything, so she offers them something for free. The Director makes it clear in Zola’s response that the negotiation can still continue if that’s what the players want.\n\n**Director:** Zola nods along as you speak. “You’re correct, but I’m not sure I can spare the people. I’ll tell you what I can do. I have spies watching Saxton still. I can give you information about his troops’ movements. Will that suffice?”\n\n**Alyssa:** I don’t think so, right?\n\n**James:** No. We need an army.\n\n**Matt:** Yeah, let’s push it.\n\n**Grace:** Agreed.\n\n**Alyssa:** I wonder if we can try to figure out another one of her motivations.\n\n**James:** Is there anything I know about Zola’s reputation? I have the Criminal Underworld skill.\n\n**Director:** Make a hard Reason test.\n\n**James:** That’s an 18! Success!\n\n**Director:** Korvo would know that Zola got the name Honeycut because she’s generous with the guild’s earnings. She gives all her fellow thieves a nice cut of every job.\n\nKorvo’s success has revealed Zola’s benevolence motivation.\n\n**James:** Brilliant! I think I probably would’ve shared that with the group before this.\n\n**Director:** Yeah, that makes sense.\n\n**Alyssa:** Great. I’ll say, “It would be worthwhile in other ways for your crew if you joined our side.”\n\n**Director:** Zola’s interest is piqued. “What makes you say that?”\n\n**Alyssa:** “Even before his coup, Saxton had a considerable amount of wealth. If he’s deposed, those riches need to go somewhere. The Clock will get a cut—a honey of a cut, you might say. Edmund has also promised to share his family’s fortune with any who stand with him against Saxton … after the young lord reclaims the throne, that is.”\n\n**Director:** You’re appealing to one of her motivations, so make an easy Presence test.\n\n**Alyssa:** Can I use my Persuade skill too?\n\n**Director:** Absolutely. And you gain an edge because you’re famous to her.\n\n**Alyssa:** I got a 12!\n\nBecause Jorn appealed to a motivation, Zola’s interest increases to 3, and her patience is reduced to 1. The Director gives a “Yes, but …” response while making it clear that the negotiation can still continue.\n\n**Director:** Zola contemplates this for a moment. She nods, “I’m starting to see the benefits. I think I can spare some folks to help you, but you have to help them first. See, my best warriors are locked up in Bedegar Keep. They’re supposed to be hanged in two days. If you free them, I’ll see to it they stand with you against Saxton. We were making a plan to free them ourselves, but could frankly use the help.”\n\n**Grace:** We could push the Clock to do it themselves, but I can’t see Val turning her back on people in need.\n\n**James:** Hear, hear. I’m done pushing my luck on this one.\n\n**Matt:** It’ll mean less time to recruit the other troops, so we’d better work quickly.\n\n**Alyssa:** Then we’re in agreement. I offer a handshake to Zola. “You’ve got yourself a deal.”\n\nThe negotiation ends! The heroes could have pushed for a better deal, but they’re satisfied with the offer from Zola, so they accept her terms."
