## CREATURE STATS 

Most of the information presented in a creature’s stat block is self-explanatory, and matches the statistics of hero player characters. However, a few differences are worth noting.

**(Playtest note:** Right now, creatures are color coded, but this won’t be the only way we indicate different features. Icons are coming too. What are presented in this packet are temporary playtest stat blocks until we get real layout.)

### FOR THE DIRECTOR

The information in this Bestiary playtest packet is for the Director, and all references to “you” in the packet refer to the director. If you’re a player who isn’t planning on also running games, you should stop reading now so your foes’ abilities remain a surprise.

### LANGUAGES

If a creature knows at least one language, their stat block has a **Languages** entry that shows the languages they know. Creatures who don’t know any languages don’t have this entry.

### KEYWORDS

Each creature has one or more keywords. These keywords don’t necessarily mean anything on their own, but special rules might apply to them. For instance, a creature with the **Goblin** keyword benefits from and can contribute to goblin **Villain Power** abilities (see below).

### ENCOUNTER VALUE

Each Director-controlled creature has an **encounter value** (abbreviated **EV**) that is used in building encounters. See **Encounter Building** for more information.

### CREATURE FREE STRIKES

When a Director-controlled creature makes a free strike, they don’t roll. Instead, their stat block features a **Free Strike** stat representing the amount of damage they deal with a melee free strike with a distance of **reach 1** or the creature’s signature action, whichever is higher. This is also the amount of damage they deal with a ranged free strike with a distance equal to **5** or the range of the creature’s signature action, whichever is higher. A creature’s free strike has the **Attack** keyword and any of the following words found in their signature action: **Magic**, **Psionic**, or **Weapon**. Additionally, if the creature’s signature action deals damage with a type, the free strike also uses that type. If the creature’s signature action deals more than one type of damage, the Director decides which damage type the creature’s free strike uses when the attack is made.

Creature free strikes are a static number for two reasons. First, it keeps gameplay fast. You don’t have to stop play to roll dice, and there’s no chance of a creature rolling a critical hit and bogging things down further when it isn’t their turn. Second, by keeping these static values relatively low, heroes are encouraged to take more risks when it really counts, even if that might result in them taking damage from a free strike.

#### CREATURE OPPORTUNITY ATTACKS

Even though a Director-controlled creature doesn’t have to roll when they make a free strike, if they have a **bane** on attacks against a creature, they still can’t make an opportunity attack against them.

### SIGNATURE ACTION

Every creature has a **signature action**, which is the first action that appears in their stat block.

### TRAITS

Many creatures have **traits**, which are features that don’t require an action, maneuver, or triggered action to activate, such as the goblin monarch’s **Crafty** trait.

### MALICE ABILITIES

Many creatures have abilities and features that require a resource called **malice** to activate. See **Malice** for more information.

### END EFFECT

Certain creatures have the ability to take damage in order to end one **EoE** (end of encounter) effect currently affecting them. The damage the creature takes to end the effect can’t be reduced in any way.

### VILLAIN ACTIONS

The solo and leader creatures presented in this book are designed to be fought in climactic battles at the end of an adventure or campaign. Because of this, they get special abilities called **villain actions**.

A creature with villain actions always has three. Each villain action can be used only once per encounter, and no more than one villain action can be used per round. A creature can use a villain action at the end of any other creature’s turn during combat. Villain actions are numbered and intended to be used in a specific order that creates a logical encounter flow and cinematic arc, but you can use them in any order you choose.

The first villain action is an **opener**, which shows the heroes they’re not battling a typical creature. Openers generally deal some damage, summon a lackey or three, buff the leader, debuff the heroes, or move the creature into an advantageous position. They’re a taste of what’s to come.

The second villain action provides **crowd control**. It typically activates after the heroes have had a chance to respond once or twice to the villain, move into position, and surround the villain. This second action helps the villain regain the upper hand. Like an opener, this action comes in many flavors, but it’s even more powerful than an opener.

The third and final villain action is an **ultimate move** or “ult”—a showstopper that the villain can use to deal a devastating blow to the heroes before the end of the battle.

If you have more than two creatures with villain actions in an encounter (which should be a rare, if at all occurrence), only one villain action total may be used per round.

### RESISTANCE ROLL ABILITIES

Some creature abilities say “[Characteristic Abbreviation] RR” instead of providing a dice equation. This means that instead of the creature rolling when the ability is used, the target of the ability must make a resistance roll with the indicated characteristic against the ability’s effects.

### CREATURE ROLES

A creature’s role describes its function in combat in a general sense. Roles are descriptive, and most don’t follow special rules—they simply help you build encounters and use creatures effectively in combat. **(Playtest note:** A lot more guidance for using roles in building encounters is coming.)

#### AMBUSHER

Ambushers are melee warriors who can slip by beefier heroes to reach squishier targets in the back lines.

#### ARTILLERY

Artillery creatures fight best from afar, and can use their most powerful abilities at great distance.

#### LEADER

Leader creatures are powerful commanders who often serve as villains at the climax of adventures and campaigns. They have better Stamina and damage output than other creatures, and often aid those creatures—or can sacrifice lesser allies for their own benefit.

#### BRUTE

Brutes are hardy creatures who have lots of Stamina and deal lots of damage. They have abilities and traits that make them difficult to ignore and hard to get away from, and that let them push enemies around.

#### CONTROLLER

Controllers are creatures who change the battlefield, often with magic or psionics. They reposition foes and alter terrain to make it more advantageous for their allies. Controllers are often on the squishier side, so they need some protection!

#### DEFENDER

Defenders are tough creatures able to take a lot of damage, and who can force enemies to attack them instead of squishier targets. Defenders often act in squads with allies who have lower Stamina, such as controllers and hexers.

#### HARRIER

Harriers are mobile warriors who make definitive use of hit-and-run tactics. Their traits allow them to make the most of their positioning on the battlefield.

#### HEXER

Hexers specialize in debuffing enemies with conditions and other effects. They are generally squishy and rely on allies to help defend them.

#### MOUNT

Mounts are mobile creatures meant to be ridden in combat, and who make their riders even more dangerous. Mounts act at the same time as their riders.

#### SOLO

A solo creature is an action-oriented creature capable of taking on the player characters on their own, or with the backup of just a handful of underlings. **(Playtest note:** There are no solo creatures in this packet.)

#### SUPPORT

Support creatures specialize in aiding their allies, providing buffs, healing, movement, or action options.

## CREATURES WHO GRAB

If a creature has an ability or trait that allows them to grab another creature, they can have only one creature grabbed at a time unless their stat block specifies otherwise. If the creature has already grabbed the maximum number of creatures, the ability or trait used to grab can’t be used against another target unless the creature releases an already grabbed target.

## MINIONS

Minions are weaker enemies who are made to die fast and to be threatening in large squads. **Minion** is a monster role that always has another role such as artillery or brute attached to it, so you know what the minion does well in addition to being a minion.

The knowledge of how minions work isn’t a secret, and shouldn’t be kept from the players. Share the information in this section with them! They’ll have a lot more fun battling minions and shaping narrative around taking out multiple foes at once if they understand how the rules work.

### ORGANIZED AS SQUADS

Minions with the same name (for instance, “goblin sniper”) can be organized into squads. All members of a minion squad act together on the same initiative, and can make squad attacks (see **Squad Action**).

### SHARED LOW STAMINA

Minions have low Stamina and fall quickly in battle. They allow heroes to feel extra heroic, since a hero might kill several minions at once, depending on those minions’ level and encounter value!

Each squad of minions shares a **Stamina pool**, with initial Stamina equal to each individual minion’s Stamina multiplied by the number of minions in the squad. For example, goblin snipers each have Stamina 5, so a squad of four snipers has a Stamina pool of 20. Whenever a minion in a squad takes damage, the squad’s Stamina pool is reduced by a number equal to the damage taken.

Because minion Stamina is tracked as a pool, minions can’t be winded and can’t regain Stamina during a battle.

#### DROPPING ONE MINION

Whenever a minion squad’s Stamina pool is reduced by an amount equal to an individual minion’s Stamina, one minion dies or otherwise gets taken out of the fight. If a squad of goblin snipers has its Stamina pool reduced to 15, then the minion who took the damage that reduced the pool dies. When the Stamina pool hits 10, 5, and finally 0, another minion in the squad dies. If multiple minions take the damage that results in the pool dropping low enough to kill one minion, the creature who dealt the damage to the minions decides which of those minions dies.

#### DROPPING MULTIPLE MINIONS

If a single attack reduces a minion squad’s Stamina pool by an amount of damage equal to the Stamina of multiple minions, multiple minions are taken out by the damage. Start with minions who took the damage first. If all those minions are eliminated and there is still more damage to account for, the minions nearest to the ones who were taken out suffer the same fate.

For instance, if one goblin sniper takes 12 damage from a fury’s **Brutal Slam** ability, that sniper dies and another nearby sniper also gets taken out. Allow the player to narrate how their hero takes out additional minions killed by a single attack. Maybe each minion is within striking distance of the hero, who makes multiple brutal weapon attacks with a single action. Maybe the body of the original target is hurled into an unfortunate ally. Maybe additional minions affected by a single attack pass out from fright! Taking out multiple minions is a chance to play up the cinematic part of the game.

#### DAMAGING MULTIPLE MINIONS

Minion squads are particularly susceptible to damage-dealing area abilities and attacks that target multiple creatures, because the minion squad’s Stamina pool takes damage each time an individual minion takes damage. If three goblin minions are hit with a conduit’s **Lightfall** ability that deals 4 holy damage to each target in its area, the minion pool loses 12 Stamina!

#### PREPPING MINION STAMINA POOLS

When you’re preparing a battle with minions, it helps to take a moment and write out the different amounts of damage at which a minion squad suffers a loss of one of their minions. For instance, a squad of goblin snipers loses a minion when they take a total of 5, 10, 15, and 20 damage. If you do the math before combat starts (or take a quick moment to jot it down during a pause in combat), it’ll help things run smoothly.

### DIFFERENT MINION STRENGTHS

Some minions are stronger than others. This lets you create squads of differing numbers of minions to keep the heroes on their toes as you build encounters that fit your needs. Some minions attack and die in droves, such as the lowly pitling demon with Stamina 4. Others might be able to absorb the damage of one or two signature actions before they drop, such as the radenwight ratagast with Stamina 12. Both are level 1 minions, but their EVs are different. Fewer ratagasts can and should be used in a battle as compared to pitlings, and the heroes will need to use their best abilities to kill several of those more powerful minions at once.

### ACTING TOGETHER

When minions act, each minion in the squad must use their action in concert. This is because minions have squad attacks that require participation from all minions, requiring all individual attacks to happen at the same time. Like all creatures, an individual minion—or all the minions in a squad—can elect to take no action on a turn.

#### MINION ACTION ECONOMY

Minion turns are meant to be short. On their turn, each minion can take only a move action and an action, a move action and a maneuver, or two move actions.

Minions can make opportunity attacks, but they typically don’t have bespoke triggered actions, keeping them easy to run.

#### SQUAD ACTION

Each minion has a **signature action** that is an attack ability targeting one creature. When multiple minions in a squad use their signature action on a turn, make one roll for the whole squad. Each minion must target a different creature with their signature action. Many minion signature actions benefit from the squad being close together, so don’t spread them out too far!

If a squad has minions who don’t use their signature action, those minions can still contribute to the squad’s effectiveness. Each such minion can use an action to increase the damage to one target of the signature action by an amount equal to the minion’s free strike value, as long as that target is within distance of the minion as if the minion were using the action, and the minion has line of effect to the target.

If a minion squad gets a critical hit with their signature action, then all the minions who participated in using the action can use the action again.

#### TRACKING SQUADS

If you use multiple squads made up of the same type of minions in an encounter—for instance, two squads of goblin spinecleavers—it’s important to make it easy for the players to tell the squads apart. You can use different miniatures for each squad, or give each squad’s miniatures an indicator (a colored magnet, ring, sticker, and so forth) to help you and your players keep track of which minions are part of the same squad as they start moving around on the battlefield. Many online virtual tabletops have tools for adding colors or textures to icons that make tracking different squads easy.

### ATTACHED CAPTAIN

Any non-mount creature who speaks a language a squad of minions can understand can be attached to that squad as a captain. Captains aren’t necessarily strategic leaders with brilliant strategies. Sometimes they’re just powerful creatures who bully, inspire, or have some supernatural influence that drives other creatures to action.

A squad of minions can only have one captain, and a creature can’t be captain to more than one squad of minions.

#### SEPARATE ACTIONS AND STAMINA

A captain takes their turn at the same time as the members of their squad but isn’t limited in their action options as minions are. A captain’s Stamina isn’t added to a minion squad’s Stamina pool and is tracked as for any other creature in combat.

#### CAPTAIN BENEFITS

While a minion squad has a captain, each minion in the squad gains a **+1 bonus to speed**. Additionally, the captain gains an **edge on attacks** against creatures who are adjacent to one or more of their minions.

#### I AM THE CAPTAIN NOW

If a squad of minions loses their captain, a new allied creature can become that squad’s captain at the start of the round.

## ENCOUNTER BUILDING

We’re still working on these guidelines, and need to add information about how environment, party composition, and the like affect encounters. But for this playtest, the basics of encounter building are as follows.

### STEP 1: CHOOSE ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY

First, determine how difficult an encounter you want to create based on the following guidelines.

#### TRIVIAL ENCOUNTERS

Trivial encounters are easier than easy. They present no challenge at all for the heroes, who are guaranteed to survive the battle with their Stamina mostly, if not entirely, untouched. Think 10th-level heroes taking on a small band of typical kobolds. There’s no way it ends well for the kobolds. These encounters can be fun to occasionally throw into your game, but for many groups, the novelty disappears quickly, so that too many trivial encounters can feel like a waste of time.

Unless you determine otherwise, trivial encounters don’t earn the heroes any Victories.

#### EASY ENCOUNTERS

Unless the heroes have already depleted most of their Stamina and Recoveries, easy encounters won’t threaten their lives. Easy encounters are great for adventures that want to give the heroes a lot of battles between respites, or for when you want the heroes to feel like superheroes while still overcoming a combat challenge that feels as though it’s within their pay grade.

An easy encounter is worth **1 Victory**.

#### STANDARD ENCOUNTERS

Standard encounters are the most common for many adventuring groups. These battles deplete some of the heroes’ Stamina and Recoveries, especially from melee-focused characters. Although character death is uncommon in a standard encounter, it isn’t impossible, especially if a player makes a poor tactical choice or just finds that the dice are against them.

A standard encounter is worth **1 Victory**.

#### HARD ENCOUNTERS

Hard encounters are typically climactic encounters with leaders and their loyal servants, or some other scenario that puts the heroes’ lives in an equal amount of peril. Hard encounters are winnable, but the heroes need to play smart to survive.

A hard encounter is worth **2 Victories**.

#### EXTREME ENCOUNTERS

Extreme encounters feature threats of a level that the heroes aren’t likely to survive if they try to fight to the bitter end. Such encounters rarely appear in most campaigns, though if the heroes are 8th level or higher, they can typically survive such encounters—or have a good chance of coming back to life afterward.

If the heroes overcome an extreme encounter, they should be awarded at least **2 Victories**.

### STEP 2: DETERMINE ENCOUNTER DIFFICULTY

To determine how many creatures and other types of challenges you should have in an encounter, you need to figure out the heroes’ **encounter strength** (abbreviated **ES**).

To calculate a group’s ES, first determine each hero’s encounter worth. This starts at a baseline of **12**, then you add **3** for each level of the hero. For instance, a 3rd-level hero has an encounter worth of **21** (12 + 3 + 3 + 3). Then add the encounter worth of all heroes together, and that’s your ES. For instance, a group of five 3rd-level heroes has an ES of **105**.

#### FACTOR IN VICTORIES

Victories make heroes more powerful on their way to the next level. For each **3 Victories** the heroes earn, increase the overall ES as if there were another hero in the party. For instance, if a party of 3rd-level heroes has **3 Victories**, increase the ES by **21**. If they have **6 Victories**, increase the ES by **42**. Be careful that the larger ES doesn’t lead you to using more creatures than recommended in **Number of Creatures**. It’s usually better to use higher-cost creatures in an encounter rather than add lots when increasing ES thanks to Victories.

Since you can rarely predict the exact order in which the heroes will face encounters during an adventure, it helps to keep a list of monsters with an **EV cost** worth roughly the encounter worth of one, two, and three heroes that make sense for the adventure you’re running. You can easily drop or swap these creatures into an encounter on the fly.

### STEP 3: DETERMINE ENCOUNTER BUDGET

Once you know your ES and have chosen your encounter difficulty, you can determine your encounter budget as follows:

- **Trivial encounters** have a budget that is anything less than 75 percent of your ES.
- **Easy encounters** have a budget of between 75 and 90 percent of your ES.
- **Standard encounters** have a budget that is between 90 and 110 percent of your ES.
- **Hard encounters** have a budget of between 110 and 125 percent of your ES.
- **Extreme encounters** have a budget that is greater than 125 percent of your ES.

### STEP 4: SPEND ENCOUNTER BUDGET

You spend your encounter budget to “buy” hostile creatures to take part in your encounter. Each hostile creature costs a number of budget points equal to its encounter value (EV). When choosing creatures, try to choose a variety of roles for a more dynamic combat experience.

#### CONSIDER CREATURE LEVEL

To ensure an encounter is challenging but not devastating for the players, you want to choose creatures whose level is within 2 of the heroes’ level. For instance, creatures of level 3 through 7 are appropriate challenges for a party of 5th-level heroes. If the heroes have 6 or more Victories, you can push the upper limit to within 3 levels of the heroes.

This is really the only indicator that level serves in encounter building. Everything else relies on EV.

#### NUMBER OF CREATURES

Too many creatures or too many different stat blocks in an encounter can create a big cognitive load for you and turn exciting encounters into slogs.

In general, you don’t want more than five creatures per hero at a time in an encounter. If the encounter has more than two creatures per hero, at least half the creatures in that encounter should be minions.

When it comes to the number of stat blocks, you generally don’t want to use more than six different kinds of stat blocks in an encounter, though you can probably manage more if you’re using a lot of simple minion stat blocks. If you’re just starting out as a Director, keep the variety small until you’re confident in your ability to run a complex combat encounter.

#### STAR OF THE SHOW

Sometimes a combat encounter features a creature that you want to stick around for more than a round of combat and leave a lasting impression on the heroes. These are typically the named villains who the heroes face in the climax of an adventure or campaign.

If you want a creature to stick around and leave a lasting impression in a combat encounter, make it a hard encounter and choose a leader or solo creature with an EV that is at least half the encounter budget to be the star of the show.

### STEP 5: BUILD INITIATIVE GROUPS

Once you have your creatures selected, you’ll put them together in initiative groups, with all creatures in the same initiative group acting on the same turn.

Though it’s not a hard and fast rule, you can keep the following guideline in mind as you build initiative groups: The total EV of an initiative group should be between the encounter worth of one to two heroes (see Step 2 above). This helps to ensure that each encounter group can hold its own against any character in the party without overwhelming that character.

It’s okay to have one group with a total EV less than that. It’s also okay for a group to be worth more than two heroes, as long as that group consists of a single creature or the heroes have racked up a lot of Victories.

#### HOW MANY INITIATIVE GROUPS?

In a battle without a solo creature, you generally want about as many initiative groups as there are heroes plus or minus two. This gives you a healthy range to play with and makes your turns effective without being overwhelming for the heroes.

## MALICE

Just as every hero has a Heroic Resource determined by their class, so too do the heroes’ foes need their own juice to fuel their strongest threats. **Malice** is a resource gained by the Director. You use malice to let enemies in the game activate their most powerful abilities and throw surprises at the heroes during combat.

### EARNING MALICE

At the start of each round of combat, you gain malice equal to the number of heroes in the battle, plus the average number of Victories per hero, plus the number of the round of combat that has just begun. For instance, if five heroes with three Victories each are just starting their first round of combat, then you gain 9 malice—5 for the number of heroes, 3 for the average number of Victories, and 1 for it being the first round of combat. At the start of the second round, provided all the heroes are still alive, you gain 10 malice.

If a hero dies, they stop generating malice for you in this way. At the end of an encounter, all your villain power disappears.

It’s up to you if you want to show your players how much malice you have. Some Directors feel the tension of watching malice creep up and can create great drama, while others like to keep the players guessing about what could come next. Do whatever is most fun for your group, and if you’re not sure, ask your players what they would prefer!

### SPENDING MALICE

Non-minion monsters can spend malice the way heroes spend their heroic resources, activating and enhancing their abilities. Abilities that make use of malice have the cost noted in a creature’s stat block.

Specific types of monsters sometimes have other ways they can spend malice, typically on features that affect an entire group of enemies or that affect the encounter environment. Such features can be found in the “[Creature] Malice” section in a creature type’s overall write-up.

You won’t be able to spend your malice on every single option a given encounter has to offer. It’s totally up to you how you deploy malice. You can spend it on smaller, but still impactful, features each round. You can save it up and use it on some very dramatic abilities. You can spend it on the same feature that uses all your malice each round and then forget about it until the next. Do whatever is most fun for you and your players in a given encounter.

# BESTIARY

## ANKHEG

Pebbles click as the ground quivers. A spray of rock and earth shatters the afternoon’s peace, and an ankheg blooms from the earth. Their mandibles drip sizzling acid as a talon impales their next meal: sometimes a fat sheep, other times a shepherd.  
  
An ankheg is a chitinous, burrowing monstrosity larger than a horse. Their hooked claws and serrated mandibles are fearsome weapons, but even more dangerous is the stream of caustic spittle they use to dissolve their prey.  
  
**PASTORAL PEST**  
Although ankhegs can be found anywhere, they are a particular plague in settled lands. Ankhegs hunt alone, lurking a few feet below roadways and pastures. When their sensitive antennae detect movement above, they burst from the earth, dragging living prey into their tunnels to be devoured. These hit-and-run tactics make ankhegs virtually impossible to eradicate—unless they have the bad luck to ambush a party of well-armed adventurers. Many communities pay a handsome bounty for a slain ankheg.  
  
**TERROR OF THE THAW**  
Ankhegs are a year-round menace in the warmest lands. In temperate places, ankhegs hibernate during the winter, granting farmers a season of peace … but this respite is paid for on the first thaw of spring, when every ankheg awakens ravenous on the same day and bursts from the ground to feed.  

**ANKHEG MALICE**  
At the start of any ankheg’s turn, you can spend malice to activate one of the following features.  

- **Burning Maw (3 Malice)**: The ankheg dribbles acid over their mandibles, and deals 8 acid damage the next time they use their Bite ability before the end of their turn.  

- **Geyser (5 Malice)**: Ankheg tunnels underneath the encounter map cause a sudden influx of hot gas to burst from a 2-square-by-2-square area on the ground. Each enemy in an affected square must make an Agility resistance roll:  
  - ✸ ≤11: 3 damage; vertical push 5; prone  
  - ★ 12–16: 3 damage; vertical push 2  
  - ✦ 17+: The target shifts to the nearest unoccupied space outside the area.  

- **Earth Sink (7 Malice)**: The area of the encounter map slowly sinks into the ground. Each creature who starts their turn on the ground and can’t burrow must spend 1 extra square of movement to leave their starting position, or 2 squares if they start their turn prone or restrained. A creature who starts and ends their turn in the same space and can’t burrow is restrained by the ground (save ends).

## BASILISKS

They’re great guard dogs. You just gotta raise ’em from eggs. No, no. Don’t look her in the eye. She turned the tax collector to stone the other day when he tried to pet her. She’s just a big softie, really.  

**STONE COLD LOOKS**  
With eight legs, a scaled rough hide, and razor-sharp teeth coated in poison, the basilisk is a deadly threat—even aside from their petrifying eye beams. This dreadful creature can fell the mightiest of foes with a look, turning them into immobilized stone statues. Horrifyingly, the basilisk’s petrified prey remain aware of their fate and surroundings, trapping them in an unending nightmare.  

**RAISING YOUNG**  
Basilisks typically live in mated pairs and raise small clutches of younglings from the comforts of damp caves. Adults prefer to subsist on berries, fish, fowl, and carrion, resorting to eating their petrified victims only when starving. On the other hand, basilisk younglings can only eat petrified victims, and families of basilisk have been known to travel far from their nest to populated areas in search of prey for their babies.  

**DANGEROUS SERVITORS**  
Crime lords and overminds seek basilisk eggs to raise and train as bodyguards and pets. Training is dangerous, and many handlers (and their unscrupulous colleagues) find themselves turned to stone as the basilisk escapes and runs amok.  

Some creatures keep basilisks not for their terrifying abilities, but for their immunity to petrification. Medusas, largely due to their own limited options for companionship, commonly keep basilisks as pets. Both parties benefit from this symbiotic relationship, as the medusa feeds their own victims to the basilisk and their younglings.  

**ALCHEMICAL PROPERTIES**  
Alchemists have discovered that after a basilisk eats petrified flesh, the basilisk’s gullet produces an oil that can be used to restore a petrified victim. Unsavory alchemists pay good money to those willing to steal a basilisk youngling from their nest.  

**ALCHEMICAL INGREDIENTS**  
After a basilisk dies, a creature can make a medium Reason test on the basilisk’s gullet. On a success, the creature creates 3 doses of salve. One dose of salve can be applied to a petrified creature as an action, and 1 minute after the salve is applied, the petrified condition ends for that creature.  

On a success with a consequence, you produce 1 dose of salve but cannot extract more from the spent gullet without completing a Find A Cure project. On a failure with a consequence, you can only rely on completing a Find A Cure project to extract enough salve from the gullet.  

**BASILISK MALICE**  
At the start of a basilisk’s turn, you can spend malice to activate one of the following features.  

- **Stone Swim (3 Malice)**: A basilisk acting this turn adds the burrow keyword to their movement and moves up to their speed. The basilisk can burrow into stone this way, including vertically. While burrowing, the basilisk has concealment.  

- **Upchuck (5 Malice)**: A basilisk acting this turn spits out a chunk of a past petrified victim with the following ability.

## BREDBEDDLE

In their true forms, bredbeddles are ogre-sized, headless giants. Forever searching for their missing heads, they are drawn to populous lands, where they decapitate passers-by and magically adopt their victims’ forms.  

Although bredbeddles have no traditional sensory organs of their own, they are keenly aware of their surroundings. Some lurk along dark country lanes in their monstrous true forms. Others walk disguised among crowds, dropping their facades only long enough to waylay a stranger and lop off their head.  

**IMMORTAL WANDERERS**  
Bredbeddles don’t age, and if they are slain, their bodies reform a few days later. Long ago, bredbeddles were giants who stood high among the nobility of giant kind. But when they declared themselves rulers of all giant kind, their kin thwarted the coup and beheaded the bredbeddles. Now these fallen nobles search the world for their missing heads, each wielding the axe that decapitated them. Many claim their heads are kept for safekeeping in some fire giant’s cellar to be returned after an indeterminate period of good behavior (which the bredbeddles have thus far not exhibited).  

**GREEN WITH FRENZY**  
The longer a bredbeddle goes without a head, the more twisted and desperate their power grows. Their desire to be whole stretches out of their body in the form of shadowy dark-green ribbons, wrapping around and clinging to every surface they spill onto.  

Travelers warn one another of roads rumored to be haunted by “wild green knights,” with many avoiding those routes for months. For no journey is worth losing your head over.  

**BREDBEDDLE MALICE**  
At the start of any bredbeddle’s turn, you can spend malice to activate one of the following features.  

- **Engreen (3 Malice)**: The bredbeddle’s axe lengthens and turns a ghastly green, increasing the distance of the bredbeddle’s melee attack and the dimensions of their area abilities by 1 until the end of their turn.  

- **Shadow Stockade (5 Malice)**: A shadowy size 1L stockade seeps out from under the bredbeddle’s feet into an unoccupied square within 10 squares. When a size 1L or smaller enemy enters the stockade’s square, they are restrained (save ends). When a restrained creature frees themselves, the stockade fades away. At the start of each of the bredbeddle’s subsequent turns, they can slide the stockade and any creature in it up to 3 squares.  

- **Green Phantom (7 Malice)**: A phantom second bredbeddle phases into view, appearing in an unoccupied space anywhere on the encounter map, then vanishing at the end of the round. The phantom bredbeddle shares the original bredbeddle’s statistics and current Stamina, has magic immunity 10, and can fly. The phantom bredbeddle can take turns and use the bredbeddle’s abilities, but can’t take any villain actions. Only one phantom bredbeddle can be active during an encounter.

- **End Effect**: At the end of their turn, the bredbeddle can take 5 damage to end one save ends effect affecting them. This damage can’t be reduced in any way.  

**Resilient Form**  
The bredbeddle can’t be physically transformed in any way except by their Heady or Not trait.  

**Heady or Not**  
While headless, the bredbeddle can move into a space with a severed head and attach it to their neck. Doing so physically transforms the bredbeddle, who takes on the size, weight, reach, and stability of the head’s original owner. These effects last until the bredbeddle is killed or beheaded, or until the head falls off after 24 hours. A head that falls off can no longer be attached to the bredbeddle.  

A creature must succeed on a hard Might test made as a maneuver to rip a head off the bredbeddle. If they fail, the bredbeddle can use Executioner’s Swing against them.

- ✸ 17+: 13 damage; bleeding (save ends) or M4 beheaded (see effect)  
  - Effect: A beheaded target has their head fall into an unoccupied square adjacent to the bredbeddle, but they remain alive. While beheaded, the target is dazed and can’t have line of effect to any creature other than themselves. The beheaded target can survive without their head for 24 hours, and can reattach their head by entering its square and using a maneuver to do so. A target who remains beheaded for 24 hours dies.  

**Scramble (Maneuver)**

## BUGBEARS

The early goblins that first stepped foot into the wode never stepped out with the same two feet. Their bodies experienced (and still experience) what is now known as "The Büggey," rapidly shifting into wild new shapes and forms over the course of a few centuries. Their heads swelled into gourds and then morphed into lion faces. Their limbs stretched and swelled. They grew incredibly tall and then shrank back down. And by this point, they’ve turned every color of the rainbow.  

Today they are known as the bugbears who stand tall, furry, and striped. Only the wode knows what tomorrow holds.  

**THROWN INTO THE FRAY**  
Bugbears seldom seek other civilizations for trade or allyship. They usually appear to defend their own homes or their neighbors' homes. This has given them a reputation of being covert, insurgent warriors, when in reality the bugbears fight to maintain their quiet solitude.  

When the modern bugbear is compelled to take action, they take to the high ground and use their powerful arms to throw anything they can down at the problem. This includes daggers, heavy iron balls, each other, and sometimes throwing the enemy at the enemy.  

**GOBLIN BOND**  
Bugbears see themselves akin to both goblins and hobgoblins despite the three branching apart so dramatically. Bugbears themselves are already in a constant state of change, nearly to the point of being unable to recognize their own faces. This common philosophy of treating them all as fellow goblins provides a sense of grounding when cloistered bugbears come out of isolation, and it’s not uncommon to see bugbears work alongside groups of goblins or hobgoblins.  

**BÜGGEY MAGIC**  
There exist bugbears that have learned to channel "the Büggey" within them into green shapechanging magic. These channelers reshape the reality around them and temporarily alter their foes as defensive tactics, providing ample warning to offenders that they are capable of far worse if they push onward. The Büggey magic also allows bugbears to hide their settlements behind dense thicket and jagged boulder fields.  

**BUGBEAR LANGUAGES**  
Most bugbears speak Caelian and Szetch.  

**BUGBEAR MALICE**  
At the start of a bugbear’s turn, you can spend malice to activate one of the following features.  

- **Grab Iron Ball (3 Malice)**: A bugbear acting this turn grabs an iron ball that they can use with their Throw ability. A creature hit by the iron ball takes 3 extra damage and is slowed (EoT).  

- **Grab Javelin (5 Malice)**: A bugbear acting this turn grabs a javelin that they can use with their Throw ability. A creature hit by the javelin takes 7 extra damage and is bleeding (save ends). While bleeding this way, the bugbear or an ally can use a free maneuver to pull 2 on the creature while they’re within 2.  

- **Büggaboo (7 Malice)**: A bugbear infuses the battle map with Büggey magic until the end of the encounter. All bugbears and their allies have their speed doubled and gain the climb keyword to their speed. All affected creatures then move up to their speed.

## CHIMERA

Massive flexing claws. Lashing draconic tail. Nimble leathery wings. And not one, but three menacing heads: a snarling lion, a helix-horned ram, and a dragon with fire sparking in its throat. Many see the chimera as an aggressor, but few know its origins as a divine guardian.  

**THE FIRST CHIMERA**  
The first chimera was a gift. A deity gave a devout queen this young guardian—one with the intelligence of a dragon, the bravery of a lion, and the tenacity of a ram. The queen raised the chimera to be a strong protector of not just her person, but of her people, who loved the chimera and their ruler. But neighboring lands feared the monstrosity. As a conquering force swept into the land, their first defilement of peace was slaughtering the chimera.  

The queen’s resulting fury was said to be felt by the gods. As she screamed, a nearby volcano erupted, spewing basalt and chimeras over the land. With fiery might, the chimeras overtook the opposing army and dispersed. Each found a new territory and claimed the role of divine protector over that place, its inhabitants, and its treasures.  

**TACTICAL WARRIORS**  
Chimeras have many ways to keep themselves and their charges from being cornered. The lion head snaps up enemies in massive jaws and hurls them away, the ram head pummels them to the ground, and the dragon head bathes them in fire. The sound of the three heads crying together can shake even the most stalwart warriors.  

**ONE BEING, THREE HEADS**  
Unlike many other multiheaded creatures, a chimera has a single mind. Their heads work together, never snapping at one another over food, favors, or personality conflicts. The heads often express the chimera’s emotions in unison, braying together in times of battle or purring all at once to show affection.

**CHIMERA MALICE**  
At the start of a chimera’s turn, you can spend malice to activate one of the following features.  

- **Defensive Snapping (3 Malice):** The chimera takes up a defensive stance. Until the start of their next turn, the chimera can make a free strike against each enemy that comes within 2 of them.  
- **Unstable Terrain (5 Malice):** The chimera shakes the crowd, causing loose rocks or debris to appear. Create three Size 1L stone objects anywhere on the battlefield. Each creature adjacent to one of the objects when it appears takes A2 5 damage.  
- **Ashen Clouds (7 Malice):** Until the beginning of the chimera’s next turn, the entire battle map is concealed by a thick cloud of ash. The chimera ignores concealment. Each enemy R1 can’t establish line of effect beyond 3 squares until the cloud dissipates. The potency of this feature increases each time it’s used.

## DEMONS

Demons spawn in the Abyssal Wasteland, where evil and chaos meet. These creatures of incarnate evil crave violence and suffering in the way most other creatures need food. A demon cares only for themself, and they torture and tear apart lesser demons for fun.  

The bestial appearance of each demon is unique, composed of a chaotic arrangement of teeth, claws, and limbs meant for killing. Even demons of the same kind have unique features. One might bear an extra set of eyes or teeth, while another could have a human arm growing from their forehead.  

**MORTAL ALLIANCES**  
Demons form temporary alliances with evil mortals in exchange for souls to consume. Such alliances create carnage with alarming efficiency, though they inevitably collapse when the demons decide to devour their foolish partners. The only creature who can truly keep a demon in line is a more powerful demon.  

**SOUL REAVERS**  
Demons feast not on food or water, but on souls. Souls fuel their anarchic powers, and while starved for souls, a demon can scarcely think. Whenever a demon kills a creature with a soul, they consume that soul and keep its energy within their body. A demon can then burn that soul energy to enact their most devastating abilities.  

**DEMONIC HIERARCHY**  
Mortal scholars have classified demons into ten categories, and the higher a demon’s category, the more powerful the fiend. Though demons don’t use these classifications themselves, this system reflects their hierarchy, as stronger demons bully the weak into service.  

Each time a demon consumes a soul, there’s a chance they might evolve into a more powerful demon. The evolution from one category to the next can be instant, or it can take years. This inconsistency has led to much scholarly debate on whether all souls are equal, or whether demonic evolution is aided by the consumption of souls that are especially corrupt—or heroic.  

The following demons have been identified across categories 1-3:  

- **Pitlings** resemble rodents or insects, but possess gleaming green eyes and terrible body odor, and disgorge a viscous, toxic phlegm.  
- **Ensnarers** are the result of pitlings getting ahold of an unfortunate soul. The pitling is in the process of digesting the soul of a creature, physically boring through its head, and flopping around like an appendage. The body is puppeteered and mid-transformation into a demon, with mouths forming on the creature’s hands and arms that shoot out long, barbed tongues as attacks.  
- **Frenzied** are similar to ensnarers, but their transformation into a true demon is more advanced, resulting in a fast and viscous creature full of energy and hunger for more souls.  
- **Remasches** are rumored to be the initial source of the teachings of all shadows through the College of Black Ash. These demons have physical forms blended with the nature of the wastes where they dwell. A remasch teleports around the battlefield, inflicting chaos on their enemies directly or through the minions they control.  
- **Ruinants** possess glowing eyes and tendril-ringed maws, breathe with a sickening wheeze, and have bodies covered in inflamed scars. A ruinant can inflict fresh wounds and burns on their victims in a pattern mirroring those on the demon’s own body.  
- **Torlases** are piecemeal abominations whose physical forms don’t obey the normal laws of geometry. They control the battlefield by using living flesh, whipping allies and enemies alike into advantageous positions.  
- **Bendraks** appear as an amalgamation of flesh and shards of a broken mirror, able to shape their bodies to distract and confuse their foes. A bendrak can divert an enemy’s attack to another enemy or hide themselves or allies behind dazzling reflections.  
- **Mucerons** are the result of an ensnarer going through repeated demon evolutions to become a brutish creature, covered in several mouths that shoot out barbed tongues, pulling an enemy’s attention along with pulling them physically.  
- **Chorogaunts** are terrifying demon leaders. Each is an amalgamation of several demon bodies formed into a mobile, living musical instrument. Several heads are arranged into a chorus embedded in the demon’s chest, and its ribs are upturned into a fleshy pipe organ. Their attacks entrance and confuse enemies, making them more vulnerable to other demons.  

**DEMON LANGUAGES**  
Demons speak Proto-Ctholl.  

**DEMON MALICE**  
At the start of any demon’s turn, you can spend malice to activate one of the following features:  

- **Soulburn (3 Malice):** Each demon acting this turn has an edge.  
- **Abyssal Rift (5 Malice):** Two size 2 rifts to the Abyssal Wasteland appear at locations of your choosing. Each demon within 5 squares of a rift has an edge on their attacks. Any demon can use an abyssal rift as a portal to another abyssal rift in the encounter, moving into any space in one rift and appearing immediately in any unoccupied space in the other rift. Any non-demon creature who enters the rift for the first time in a round or starts their turn there takes corruption damage equal to the level of the highest-level demon within 20 squares of a rift. An abyssal rift is an immovable object that has Stamina 25, weapon immunity 5, and holy weakness 5. As a maneuver, a creature with the Magic or Psionics skill can make a hard Reason or Intuition test while adjacent to a rift to destabilize it. On a success, the rift closes. On a failure with a consequence, the rift regains 5 Stamina. If no demons are within 20 squares of the rift, it closes.  
- **Abyssal Evolution (7 Malice):** A demon minion of your choice turns into a non-minion demon of the same level.

## DWARVES  

Possessed of a strength that belies their size, dwarven flesh is infused with stone—a silico-organic hybrid making them physically denser than humans or elves. They enjoy a reputation in Orden as savvy engineers and technologists thanks to the lore they inherited from their elder siblings, the long-extinct steel dwarves.  
They are the children of the elder god Ord. A common phrase among the dwarves is “Ord made the world.” Their way of saying, “What will be, will be.” Dwarves take great pride in knowing that along with Aan, Eth, and Kul, their god created the mundane world, and many dwarves leave their homes to see the world and seek glory in Ord’s name.  

### THE PRESS GANGS OF KAS KALAVAR  

Before Ajax came to power, the dwarves of Kas Kalavar were renowned for their disciplined constabulary. The constables were kind, kept the order, and kept the city safe. But now, the dwarves of Kas Kalavar have submitted to Ajax’s rule and pay him tribute in prisoners. Ajax has need for bodies, either as forced labor or to be used to make war dogs and grant eternal life. Most dwarves do not like this deal, but the Press Gangs of Kas Kalavar are committed to their work.  

### MARAUDER LORD  

The dwarven marauder lord has in their possession a salvaged valok communication array, which they wear like a mohawk on their head. The array gives them access to magnetomancy, allowing them to shape and levitate metal, including multiple axes in battle.  

### DWARF MALICE

- **Breaching Charge (3 Malice)**: A dwarf can destroy one adjacent object or square of wall. Each enemy adjacent to the destroyed object or square takes the object’s Stamina in damage (3 wood / 6 stone / 9 metal).

## ELVES, HIGH

The children of the solar celestials. The high elves were created to tend to the sun elves as librarians and heralds. They sequester themselves away from the world, remembering a better age before the arrival of war.

**GLAMOROUS**  
The high elves are svelte and hold an unwavering poise worthy of a noble background. They also emit a glamor that allows them to take on any skin, hair, or eye color they desire. Each person sees this glamor slightly differently, emphasizing some details over others based on one's own values and fascinations.

**CRADLES**  
The high elves employ magical porcelain structures called cradles that can change their shape and fit into the upturned ruins of their homes. Some cradles utilize minor elementals to operate on their own and acclimate to changing environments. These structures are commonplace for magic research and archaeology, serving as hardy familiars and sturdy bookcases.

**UNSEEN HANDS WILL ILLUMINATE THEIR UNCHANGED MINDS**  
Unseen Hands Will Illuminate Their Unchanged Minds are a sect of high elf radicals who believe they have stumbled upon sky elf texts detailing their downfall by the hands of the sun elves.

The sect hides among high elf society in plain sight, slowly manipulating nobles and reshaping the world as they see fit.

**SURROUND AND SUPPRESS**  
Foes that threaten high elf armies are dealt with quickly and entirely. They take advantage of each other’s magic to corral enemies together and throw huge waves of destruction upon them. Wyrds ensure there’s no escape, warping the environment into treacherous pits and, eventually, graveyards.

## ELVES, WODE

Children of the Sylvan Celestials, masters of the elf-haunted forests called wodes, these elves see all forests as their domain by birthright. They know and enjoy their reputation among humans as snatching children who wander too far into the woods. Humans should fear the trees.

Their natural ability to mask their presence, called glamor, complements their guerilla style of fighting, striking quickly from cover and then melding back into the underbrush. These traits also make those few who dwell in human cities naturally adept at urban warfare.

### WODEWORKING

Wode elves know a secret technique to use the trees of the wode to craft materials as strong as metal and to create magical constructs that act as servitor creatures, including their mounts.

### WODE ELF LANGUAGES

Most wode elves speak Caelian and Yllyric.

### WODE ELF MALICE

At the start of a wode elf’s turn, you can spend malice to activate one of the following features.

- **Forest Network (3 Malice)**: Each wode elf that ends this turn hidden can shift their speed while remaining hidden.
- **Punishing Regrowth (5 Malice)**: All wode elves have **+1** and their attacks inflict slide 2 until the end of the turn. If a target force-moved by one of these attacks ends the forced movement in difficult terrain, they are restrained (EoT).
- **Vines Everywhere (7 Malice)**: Vines emerge and rapidly grow across the entire encounter map. Each enemy must make an Agility resistance roll:
  - ✸ ≤11: 5 damage; restrained (save ends)
  - ★ 12–16: restrained (EoT)

## FOSSIL CRYPTIC

The cave-diving humans who first found fossil cryptics initially thought those beings were fossilized, reanimated skeletons of creatures predating recorded history. When the explorers’ priest presented a holy symbol and attempted to turn the cryptics, he learned these fossilized bones aren’t mindless undead—and seconds later, he wound up crushed to death by a pillar of stone.

### PRIMAL SENTRIES

In truth, these living fossil amalgamations are inhabited by elemental spirits. Fossil cryptics are found in places of otherworldly beauty with a connection to an elemental plane of Quintessence—often in caves that have remained untouched for eons or whose tunnels are laced with veins of priceless metal in exquisite fractal patterns. The elemental spirits from that plane inhabit the fossils of creatures who once protected the site, carrying on their legacy. Archaeologists, miners, and others who disturb a cryptic’s domain are ground into dust and subsumed into the cryptic’s own form.

### BONES OF THE EARTH

Though fossil cryptics vary wildly in their chosen shape and form, all contain a central cluster of fossils atop a churning column of rock and metal. With malleable limbs extending from their earthy core, cryptics move with unsettling quickness.

### ANCIENT INTELLIGENCE

Fossil cryptics often warn trespassers to leave their domains, speaking threats in ancient languages before attacking. Should trespassers persist, cryptics weaponize columns of stone at range and can manipulate the ground around them, pushing and pulling friend and foe alike into the best positions for a battle.

### FOSSIL CRYPTIC MALICE

At the start of any cryptic’s turn, you can spend malice to activate one of the following features:

- **Floor Mosaic (3 Malice)**: One creature on the ground slides up to 5 squares. This movement can’t be reduced.
  
- **Stone Pillars (5 Malice)**: Two pillars of stone that are 1 square wide thrust 5 squares up out of the ground anywhere on the encounter map. Any creature in the area of a pillar before it rises falls prone on top of it.
  
- **Choking Dust (7 Malice)**: The air across the area of the encounter map becomes thick with dust until the end of the encounter. Each enemy in the dust must immediately make a Might resistance roll, then repeat that resistance roll at the start of each of their turns:
  - ✸ ≤11: Slowed (EoT); the target’s stability is reduced by 3 (EoT).
  - ★ 12–16: The target’s speed is reduced by 2 (EoT) and their stability is reduced by 1 (EoT).
  - ✦ 17+: No effect

## GNOLLS

**Edacity.** The gnolls are marked by their hyena faces and their endless appetites. These fiends carry with them the evil legacy of their late demon lord creator. Originally from the Abyssal Wasteland, gnolls quickly spread across the timescape, and they thrive in deserts, plains, and other sparsely populated places. Though a gnoll’s muzzle is just as likely to be bloodied by carrion as by prey, their hunting packs hunger for violence, and they eagerly hunt travelers and raid settlements. The pack’s eerie war cry, a wild cackle, presages a night of battle and terror.

### BORN FROM BLOOD

The Abyssal Wasteland is an alien landscape hostile to most life. Yet amidst its desolation, fiendish creatures thrive, including abyssal hyenas—bloodthirsty scavengers who fight with other lesser fiends over the corpses of demons. The first gnolls arose when a pack of these predators lapped at the ichor oozing from the wounds of a dying demon prince, As’sylrak the Warper.

As his last act, the demon gave the fiendish hyenas a demonic cunning to match their insatiable hunger, bound his evil will to theirs, and turned their paws into hands so they could wield weapons. He called these new fiends “gnoll,” an Abyssal word that has many meanings, one of which is “to consume completely.” And true to their name, the gnolls immediately devoured their creator.

### CEASELESS HUNGER

The merciless gnolls quickly spread across the timescape in search of new victims to quench their never-ending hunger. Their packs were followed by some of the abyssal hyenas who didn’t receive As’sylrak’s blessing; these tagalongs enjoy the castoffs of the gnoll packs. Gnolls never forgot the day when they tasted immortal flesh—and they hunger for more, longing for a day when gnolls hunt the gods themselves through heavenly halls.

### GNOLL WAR

Most gnolls live for the thrill of the hunt and the taste of flesh, and they aren’t choosy with their targets. Perhaps the one saving grace for most humanoid communities is that gnoll war bands battle each other for territory, keeping their numbers reduced.

### ABYSSAL HYENAS

Stronger and smarter than their beastly counterparts, abyssal hyenas crawl out of the Abyssal Wasteland to feed on corpses gnolls leave in their wake. When reinforcements are needed, gnoll spellcasters can use magic to transform abyssal hyenas into gnolls.

### TUSKER DEMONS

Towering among a gnoll war band, the elephantine tusker demon serves as beast of burden and war machine. Tusker demons have no facial features except a twisted crown of tusks that surrounds their ravening maw. Although they usually follow gnoll commands, tuskers in lethe are prone to violent outbursts and charge at anything that moves. Enemies and allies get trampled all the same.

### GNOLL LANGUAGES

Most gnolls speak Anjal.

### GNOLL MALICE

At the start of a gnoll’s turn, you can spend malice to activate one of the following features:

- **Iron Jaws (3 Malice):** One gnoll acting this turn drops an iron-jawed snare into an unoccupied square while moving. If an enemy steps into a square with the snare in it, they must make an Agility resistance roll. If the creature was unaware of the snare, they make the roll with a bane:
  - ✸ ≤11: 5 damage; bleeding (save ends)
  - ★ 12–16: 3 damage; bleeding (EoT)
  - ✦ 17: no effect
  
  While a creature is bleeding from the snare, gnolls have edge on attacks made against the creature.

- **Bloodpool (5 Malice):** 1 minion gnoll suddenly melts into a pool of blood, splattering across each square within 3. A gnoll that starts their turn in a bloodpool has double edge on their next attack until the end of their turn. Once per round, an abyssal hyena that starts their turn in a bloodpool turns into a gnoll marauder, keeping their Stamina.

- **Echoes of Laughter (7 Malice):** The battlemap is encased in a soundscape of laughter and howling. Enemies have a bane on the first power roll they make during a round. Whenever a gnoll is killed, this effect is suppressed until the start of the next round.

## GOBLINS

As with all humanoid ancestries, different types of goblins and goblin cultures can be found across many lands, each with their own ideals. Known among themselves as *rogabrin*, meaning “more of us” in their language, goblins are one of the most numerous humanoids in the world. They can be found in every environment humans occupy and in places many other humanoids avoid, including deep cave systems.

Their long arms and prehensile toes make goblins particularly well adapted to environments requiring climbing, and they live equally comfortably in treetop cities as in subterranean realms filled with stalactites, ledges, and chasms. However, just as many prefer to dwell in tight-knit neighborhoods within diverse cities. Many of those goblins who cross swords with adventuring heroes are the worst of their society—thieves and murderers shunned by their own people.

### ENCOUNTERED IN GROUPS

Whether within a society or living in exile, goblins survive and thrive because they work together. A single goblin forced into the wild is terrified. A dozen outlaw goblins are supremely confident—perhaps overly so. Such groups often become bandits who ambush travelers crossing through their territory, be it desert, forest, or underground. Larger bands might become unscrupulous mercenaries serving powerful villains. No matter how they’re encountered, goblins prefer to fight as an overwhelming force and to flee when foes outnumber friends.

### MOBILE AND SNEAKY

Short, lithe, and long-armed, goblins are built for mobility, stealth, and climbing. Goblins who dwell in untamed wilderness and twisting caves utilize their natural agility to hide from threats and flee when found. These crafty skirmishers might run wild through battle, hacking at their enemies’ knees, or unleash arrows as they dart from tree to tree.

### GOBLIN MAGIC

Some exiled goblins forge pacts with evil entities for magical power, including archfey, deities, and fiends. Goblin assassins conjure darkness made from the souls of their victims, while goblin cursespitters hurl magic hexes that keep their enemies at bay.

### SKITTERLING

A six-legged winged rodent the size of a housecat, a skitterling moves their clawed feet as they fly, making them appear to scurry through the air. Goblins train these pets to claw at the faces of enemies, as their feet secrete a toxin that causes temporary sluggishness.

### WAR SPIDER

Goblins ride enormous arachnids as mounts in battle. With blades attached to their legs, a war spider cuts a swath through enemy forces while archers fire from atop a platform on the beast’s back. During a raid, a spider arches their body to launch warriors off their back and into the fray.

### WARG

Some goblins form a special bond with wargs—canine creatures that many goblin communities raise as mounts, guardians, and companions.

### GOBLIN LANGUAGES

Most goblins speak Caelian and Szetch.

### GOBLIN MALICE

At the start of any goblin’s turn, you can spend malice to activate one of the following features:

- **Goblin Mode (3 Malice):** Each goblin in the encounter gains a +2 bonus to speed until the end of the round.
- **Tiny Stabs (5 Malice):** Each enemy in the encounter takes 1 damage for each goblin who is adjacent to them.
- **Swamp Stink (7 Malice):** The encounter map becomes covered in a green mist that lasts until the end of the round, which can’t be dispersed by wind. All areas of the map become difficult terrain for non-goblins, and each non-goblin on the map must make a Might resistance roll.

## GRIFFONS

With the head, front legs, and wings of a bird and the powerful body and haunches of a feline, the griffon hunts anything they desire—even other predators—though they prefer to eat birds, fish, and herd animals. Griffons sometimes misjudge their prey and attack humanoids passing through their mountain or forest territories. They also fiercely defend themselves against anyone who threatens or gets too close to their nests.

### COVETED MOUNTS

Attempting to capture a wild griffon typically ends in injury or worse, though humanoids who hatch griffons in captivity and raise them from birth find they make loyal companions. Some humanoid cultures raise griffons as mounts for the military or city guard, and griffon eggs can fetch a fine price.

Daring poachers sometimes attempt to steal griffon eggs from wild aeries, but such thieves typically meet their end by griffon beak or talon. So great is the death toll that many localities have outlawed the poaching of griffon eggs.

### INACCESSIBLE AERIES

Griffons roost alone or in pairs on craggy mountainsides, in forests, or on cliffs overlooking the ocean. They hide their nests in enormous treetops, scrubby thickets clinging to a cliff, or similarly sheltered nooks that are nearly unreachable for creatures who can’t fly. Each aerie holds up to three eggs during brooding season, which lasts for several months in the early spring. Chicks hatch after forty days of incubation, then they remain in or near the nest as their parents feed the rapidly growing flightless chick.

About forty days after hatching, a griffon chick learns to fly—and after that, it’s only a matter of days before they set out from their nest into the wider world, generally making their own nest somewhere nearby.

### RARE BREEDS

Griffons come in many varieties. While the most common griffon is the leonine eagle, others include a falcon-panther variety and a bearded vulture-clouded leopard variety. The latter only feeds on carrion, and experts continue to debate whether they should be considered a true griffon or if they deserve their own categorization. Rumors of a massive condor-tiger griffon have recently sprung up, and whether or not their existence is true, it has opened questions of whether these creatures came about naturally or were fashioned by magic hands. Still, many scholars offer abundant rewards to adventurers who can return with evidence of rare or undiscovered griffon types.

### GRIFFON MALICE

At the start of a griffon’s turn, you can spend malice to activate one of the following features:

- **Swoop (3 Malice):** A griffon acting this turn can take the following maneuver:  
  **Swoop (Maneuver)**  
  Keywords: —  
  Distance: Self  
  Target: Self  
  Effect: The griffon flies up to their speed. The griffon takes a free strike against each creature that makes an opportunity attack against the griffon.
  
- **Piercing Cry (5 Malice):** A griffon acting this turn unleashes a hideous screech at an enemy within 5, forcing the creature to make an Intuition resistance roll:
  - ✸ ≤11: Frightened of the griffon (save ends)
  - ★ 12-16: Frightened of the griffon (EoT)
  - ✦ 17+: No effect
  
- **Wildwinds (7 Malice):** Winds bluster and blow throughout the battle map. Until the end of the encounter, each creature that cannot fly or is not mounted on a flying creature has their stability reduced by 5, and forced movement effects targeting them increase by 3 squares.

## HAGS

**When fear of death or hunger for power grips a mortal spellcaster, often a druid or a witch, they might forge a pact with an evil archfey. The mortal becomes a hag—aged, clawed, and cruel—another ruthlessly powerful fey in their own right. In exchange, hags use their magic to bring about the misery that their archfey wills.**

### HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT

Though hags typically appear as older humanoid women, their true form is as vicious and nasty as their nature. They prefer to show the world a charitable face, but the general wisdom concerning hags is that the more beautiful their appearance, the deeper the rot within. However, this theory has never been confirmed, as few who see a hag’s true form live to tell the tale.

### DEALMAKERS AND HEART-BREAKERS

As old age can’t kill them, the oldest hags accumulate swathes of knowledge, magic, and repute over time. They are happy to share their wares … for the right price. Rather than ask for paltry coin, a hag usually bargains for something dear to the customer—perhaps their ability to love, the sound of their child’s laugh, or their left pinky toe. Adding insult to injury, those who deal with hags almost always discover the product is worse than advertised. Mortals should pay close attention to the precise wording of their agreements, lest they end up with a hex they thought would be a gift. Such curses often lead to the corruption of good but desperate folk, and some get so twisted up in fey deals that they become hags themselves.

### WHAT’S IN A NAME?

Hags give themselves whimsical names, and older hags often select monikers like Auntie, Granny, or Nanny. Such relatable names help entice their favorite prey: the innocent. Who would fear Granny Gumdrops or Auntie Twothumbs?

### LOYAL UNDERLINGS

Hags are treacherous by nature, and they only recruit creatures they trust to be loyal underlings. Most of these creatures lack sapience (such as animals, constructs, and undead), though hags sometimes command weaker fey who are too scared to betray them.

### HAG LANGUAGES

Most hags speak Caelian, Anjal, Khelt, and Yllyric, but often go on to learn several more.

### HAG MALICE

At the start of a hag’s turn, you can spend malice to activate one of the following features:

- **Power Grab (3 Malice):** The hag gains ��� against supernatural damage until the end of the round. The Director gains 2 malice whenever the hag reduces damage this way.  
- **Hag Wyrd (5 Malice):** The hag uses the following ability.  

  **Hag Wyrd (Action)** ◆ 2d10 + 3  
  Keywords: Area, Magic  
  Distance: 10 × 1 line within 1  
  Target: All enemies  

  - ✦ ≤11: 4 fire damage; R2 frightened of the hag (save ends)  
  - ★ 12–16: 7 fire damage; R3 frightened of the hag (save ends)  
  - ✸ 17: 10 fire damage; R4 frightened of the hag (save ends)  

  **Effect:** After rolling power, the hag can choose to replace the damage type and effect of the attack with lightning and dazed (save ends) or cold and slowed (save ends).

- **House Call (7 Malice):** The hag’s hut springs to life. It enters the encounter map within 10 of the hag if it isn’t already there and takes a turn. The hut is Size-4, has 60 Stamina and Magic immunity 5, a speed of 8, and a set of powerful animal legs. This feature can’t be used if the hut is reduced to 0 Stamina. The house can only take the following action:

  **Kick (Action)** ◆ 2d10 + 3 ◆ Signature
