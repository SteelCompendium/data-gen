## Disclaimer

- To be clear, I don't dont own any of this. I just converted the docs over to markdown
- The conversion process is not perfect and there are a lot of mistakes. In particular, the headers are a big challenge that needs fixing and page breaks caused issues.
	- I will continue to update the repo as I go through it and continue to clean it up
- Diagrams are not included since Im assuming that is considered MCDM art.  I'll eventually recreate the diagrams myself in an ugly format.
